## Detailed Weekly Breakdown:

### Week 1: Orientation & Introduction to Tools

Week One will be give students the tools to build and observe the building blocks of the web. They will build with VSCode, and observe with Dev Tools. It will also give an overview of general topics like HTML, CSS, servers, files, and basic networking. These topics will come naturally as we observe websites and build code.

Week One will also give students a chance to get organized, register for accounts, and understand the requirements of the class.

During the first week, students should acquire the following things:

1. A physical notebook/notepad
2. A digital notepad in Google Docs
3. A password manager
4. A set of accounts for the class: GitHub, InVision, Replit, etc...
5. Installations of software on their machine. (Its good for them to get practice managing their machines.)
