# Week 3: Day 2 â€“ Exploring Bootstrap's Grid System and Key Components

Today's assignment will be testing your ability to generate a grid system using Bootstrap and to use some of the key components we learned about in class today.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `Bootstrap_Day2_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Create a new file named `index.html` and `styles.css`.
   - We want to continue reinforcing CSS properties as we build on these Bootstrap classes.

3. **index.html Structure**

    - Ensure you are properly bringing in Bootstrap via instructions from the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).
    - Our goal will be to replicate creating a grid system similar to what we did in class today.
    - You previously built a grid system using CSS, now we will be using Bootstrap to do the same thing.
    - Along with creating a grid system, try out the `alert`, `nav`, and `badge` components.
    - Fill these components with any content that is relevant to you and appropriate for the assignment.

4. **styles.css**

    - Ensure you have your `styles.css` file linked to your `index.html` file.
    - Add some styling to your `index.html` file using CSS.
    - There isn't any set CSS you need to be using, BUT you should be utilizing what you have learned in meaningful ways or attempting to experiment with new CSS properties.

5. **Submission**

    - Zip the "Bootstrap_Day2_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
      **or**
    - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "Bootstrap_Day2_Assignment".
