# Day 3 (Thursday) Script tags

## Overview

This is the first day of JavaScript. Since JavaScript is the hardest part of the program, we will introduce it slowly, with one day in week 1 and one day in week 2.

In the first case, we introduce the SCRIPT tag with document.write.

Check out the book Learn Ruby the Hard way. Or see my [blog post](https://blog.robertm.cc/2024/03/14/are-we-procedural-yet.html) for rational.

Goal: Today, we just want to practice writing to the document with document.write in a script tag

## Hour 1

Bird's Eye View of JavaScript.

Demo code with document.write.

Indicate that this is an intermediary step. We will not write our code this way when we learn new ways.

Review using HTML and show adding document.write in many places.

Bonus: Be creative in where you put your script tags. Can you nest one in an em tag? in a p tag? Look for more places you can put them!

Extension: Read about [document.write on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_doc_write.asp). Look at the examples and try them out yourself. Can you find something you can do in JavaScript that you couldn't already do in HTML? Read about [JavaScript output on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp) for other ways to use JavaScript to modify a page.
