# Week 5: Day 4 â€“ Deployment with GitHub Pages

## Session Outline

Focus: Introducing students to GitHub Pages for deploying static sites, starting with a `README.md` and progressing to a basic HTML website.

## Objectives

1. Understand the basics of deploying static sites using GitHub Pages.
2. Deploy a `README.md` file as a starting point for GitHub Pages.
3. Transition to deploying a basic HTML website and observe the deployment process.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Introduction to GitHub Pages

- Overview of GitHub Pages as a hosting platform for static websites.
- The process of enabling GitHub Pages in a repository.

### 2. Deploying a README.md

- Step-by-step guide to deploy a `README.md` as a static site.
- Discussion on the significance of `README.md` in GitHub repositories.

### 3. Transitioning to HTML Deployment

- Basics of creating a simple HTML file (`index.html`).
- The importance of `index.html` as the entry point for static websites.

## Hands-On Exercise: Deploying on GitHub Pages

- Initial exercise: Students deploy their `README.md` using GitHub Pages.
- Advanced exercise: Students clone their repository, add an `index.html`, and deploy it using GitHub Pages.
- Observing the transition from `README.md` to `index.html` in their GitHub Pages site.

## Assignment Preparation

- Instructions for creating a basic `index.html` file.
- Guidance on using Git for adding, committing, and pushing changes to deploy the HTML file.

## Breakout Rooms: Practicing Deployment

- Students work in groups to troubleshoot and successfully deploy their static sites.
- Emphasis on the ACP (Add, Commit, Push) process in deployment.

## Conclusion

- Recap of the steps for deploying static sites using GitHub Pages.
- Discussion on the practical applications of GitHub Pages in sharing and showcasing projects.
- Preview of Day 5: Consolidating the week's learnings and preparing for the final project.
