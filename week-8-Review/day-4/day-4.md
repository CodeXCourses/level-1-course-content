# Week 7: Day 4 – Comprehensive JavaScript Review

## Session Outline

Focus: A thorough review of fundamental JavaScript concepts including strings, arrays, objects, functions, methods, loops, and control flow.

## Objectives

1. Solidify understanding of basic data structures: strings, arrays, and objects.
2. Review function creation and usage, including standard functions and methods.
3. Reinforce knowledge of loops (`for` and `while`) and control flow with `if-else` statements.

## Announcements

- **Preparation for Capstone Project**: Consider how these JavaScript fundamentals can be applied in your upcoming project.
- **Interactive Review**: Today’s focus is on reviewing and solidifying core JavaScript concepts through practical examples and exercises.
