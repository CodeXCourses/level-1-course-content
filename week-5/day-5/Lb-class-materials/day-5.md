# Week 4: Day 5 â€“ Comprehensive Review and Variable Hoisting in JavaScript

## Overview

In today's session, we'll consolidate our knowledge from the previous four days, focusing on variables, arrays, functions, objects, and how they interact. We will also discuss the peculiarities of `var` and variable hoisting.

- **6:30 PM to 8:30 PM**: Lecture and interactive coding (includes a 10-minute break)
- **8:30 PM**: Closing remarks and Q&A

## Detailed Schedule

### 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM: Review and Interactive Coding

**Recap of Variables and Primitive Data Types (20 minutes):**

- Review variables, the different data types, and the use of `alert`, `prompt`, and `document.write`.

**Arrays and their Methods (20 minutes):**

- Revisit array manipulation methods such as `.push()`, `.pop()`, and `.join()`.

**Functions and Scope (20 minutes):**

- Discuss the role of functions, the use of arrow functions, and function scope.

**Objects and their Power (10 minutes):**

- Review the creation and manipulation of objects, including properties and methods.

### 7:30 PM - 7:40 PM: Break (10 minutes)

Give students a short break to refresh before diving into the second half of the session.

### 7:40 PM - 8:30 PM: Deep Dive into Variable Hoisting and Advanced Concepts

**Variable Hoisting with `var` (10 minutes):**

- Explain variable hoisting and demonstrate with examples why `let` and `const` are preferable.

**Advanced Concepts (40 minutes):**

- Introduce and code examples on the following topics:
  - Template Literals and Expressions
  - Default Function Parameters
  - Destructuring Assignments
  - Spread and Rest Operators

### 8:30 PM: Closing Remarks and Q&A

- Summarize key takeaways from today's session.
- Address any remaining questions and provide guidance for further study.

## Conclusion

- Recap the importance of each concept covered and how they fit into everyday coding tasks.
- Encourage the practice of newly learned skills with additional exercises and projects.

**Note:** Students should have their development environments ready for the interactive coding session. The code written today will be an essential reference for future learning and practice.
