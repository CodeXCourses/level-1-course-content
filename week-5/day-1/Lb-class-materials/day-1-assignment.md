# Week 4: Day 1 â€“ Diving into JavaScript Fundamentals and Variables

Welcome to the world of JavaScript! Today you learned about the fundamentals of JavaScript and how to use variables. Now it's time to put your knowledge to the test.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `JS_Variables_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Create a new file named `script.js` and `index.html`.
   - Note that VScode will automatically detect file types based on their extension such as `.html` or `.js`.
   - VScode will automatically color code your JavaScript file to make it easier to read.

3. **index.html**

   - Generate a generic HTML page, you are not required to bring in any elements.
   - JavaScript runs in the browser, so we need to link our JavaScript file to our HTML file.
   - Ensure you connect your `script.js` file to your `index.html` file. (use a script tag like this `<script src="script.js"></script>`)
   - **You will be utilizing your dev tools to see your console logs you create below! (hint: right click on your page and click inspect, then click on the console tab in case you need a refresher!)**

4. **script.js**

   - A good practice when creating JavaScript files is to start your file with a 'use strict'; statement. This will help you avoid common mistakes and write better code.
   - Create a variable named `firstName` and assign it a value of your first name.
   - Create a variable named `lastName` and assign it a value of your last name.
   - Create a variable named `age` and assign it a value of your age.
   - Create a variable named `isFavoriteFood` and assign it a value of true or false.
   - Create a variable named `workPhone` and leave it undefined.
   - Create some variables that are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
   - Console log each variable to the console to see what occurs and how they interact with the different data types.
   - Console log each variable and try to spell out a full sentence, such as writing our your full name and stating how old you are. (hint: look up how to concatenate strings in JavaScript)
   - Experiment with creating variables and creating varying sentences with whatever you come up with.

5. **Submission**

   - Zip the "JS_Variables_Assignment" folder.
   - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
   - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
   - Click the submit button.
     **or**
   - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "JS_Variables_Assignment".
