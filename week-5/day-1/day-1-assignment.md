# Homework for Week 5: Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Git and Basic Concepts

You've had an informative morning session learning about the significance of source control and the basics of Git. Your homework assignment is designed to reinforce what you've learned so far and prepare you for the next class.

## Instructions

Part 1: Hands-on Practice

Now, it's time to extend your hands-on experience with Git.

    Fork a new repository: Navigate to this repository,(https://github.com/ReeceRenninger/Fork-Practice). Fork it to create your copy. Make sure to note the repository's URL.

    Clone your fork: Use the Git command-line or your preferred Git client (e.g., VS Code) to clone the repository you just forked. You should have a local copy on your computer.

    Create a new markdown file: Inside your local repository, create a simple markdown file (e.g., reflections.md) with your answers to the next portion of the homework(Part 2).

    Add and commit changes: After completing your questions in part 2, stage your changes and commit them with a meaningful commit message. Push your changes to your remote repository.

Part 2: Reflection

Please answer the following questions in a well-structured paragraph(utilize your markdown file named `reflections.md` and answer these 2 questions):

    Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

    How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

Submission:

Please submit your homework by pushing the changes to your forked repository on GitHub. Make sure your markdown file and any other changes are visible in your repository.

After checking to ensure your files were properly pushed to your forked repository, submit the **link** to your forked repository in the card with the label "Your work", and click on the "+ Add or create" button. Within that dropdown, click "Link," and attach your link. Click the submit button.
