### Hands-On Exercises with Objects (30 minutes):

- Engage students in creating and manipulating objects related to real-world scenarios.
- Challenges might include:
  - Designing an object to represent a book with properties like title, author, and published year.
  - Manipulating an object representing a student's profile, updating grades or adding courses.

### Wrap-Up and Reflection (10 minutes):

- Review the core concepts associated with objects.
- Address any lingering questions to ensure clarity on objects.
- Provide a brief peek into Day 5: Recap of the week's learnings and ensuring a solid understanding of JavaScript's fundamental constructs.
