## Hour 1: Delving into Arrays

### The Concept of Arrays (15 minutes):

- Discuss arrays as ordered collections of items, which can be of mixed types.
- Highlight real-world analogies, like a list of groceries or a playlist of songs.

### Creating and Accessing Arrays (25 minutes):

- Demonstrate the creation of arrays using square brackets.
- Show how to access individual items using indices.
- Emphasize the zero-based nature of array indexing.

## Hour 2: Manipulating and Interacting with Arrays

### More Array Methods (25 minutes):

- Dive deeper into array methods, such as `splice()`, `slice()`, and `concat()`.
- Explain use cases for each method, ensuring students grasp when and why to use them.

### Interactive Array Manipulation (20 minutes):

- Students practice hands-on array creation, modification, and retrieval of items.
- Challenge: Create a script that allows users to build a list, add and remove items, and display the current list.

### Wrap-Up and Reflection (15 minutes):

- Recap the array-centric journey of Day 2.
- Engage in a Q&A session to address any challenges or misconceptions.
- Preview Day 3's content: Diving into functions, the building blocks of modular and organized code.
