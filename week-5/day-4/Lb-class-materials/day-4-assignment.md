# Week 4: Day 4 â€“ Introduction and Exploration of Objects

In today's lecture, you learned about the fundamentals of objects and how they can be used to structure and group related data in JavaScript. Now it's time to put your knowledge to the test.

## Instructions

  1. **Setup Environment**
      - Open Visual Studio Code.
      - Create a new folder named JS_Objects_Assignment on your local machine.

  2. **Create Files**
        - Create a new file named `objects.js` and `index.html`.

  3. **index.html**
      - Generate a generic HTML page; you are not required to bring in any elements.

      - Ensure you connect your script.js file to your index.html file using a script tag like this: `<script src="objects.js"></script>`.

      - You will be utilizing your dev tools to see your console logs you create below! (hint: right-click on your page and click inspect, then click on the console tab in case you need a refresher!)

  4. **script.js**

        - A good practice when creating JavaScript files is to start your file with a 'use strict'; statement. This will help you avoid common mistakes and write better code.

        - Create an object named book that represents a book with properties like title, author, and publishedYear. Fill in these properties with values of your choice.

        - Create a function named printBookInfo that takes a book object as a parameter and logs a message to the console, including all the properties of the book.

        - Create another object named studentProfile that represents a student's profile with properties like name, age, and an array courses containing a list of courses the student is taking.

        - Create a function named addCourse that takes a student profile and a new course as parameters. This function should add the new course to the student's list of courses.

        - Create a function named updateAge that takes a student profile and a new age as parameters. This function should update the student's age.

        - Call the printBookInfo function with the book object and log the book's details.

        - Call the addCourse function to add a new course to the studentProfile object.

        - Call the updateAge function to update the age of the studentProfile object.

        - Generate console logs as you alter the objects to ensure everything is functioning properly.

  5. **Submission**
        - Zip the "JS_Objects_Assignment" folder.
        - In the card with the label "Your work," click on the "+ Add or create."
        - Within that dropdown, click "File," and attach your zipped folder.
        - Click the submit button.
        **or**
        - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "JS_Objects_Assignment."
