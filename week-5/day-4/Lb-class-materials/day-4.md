# Week 4: Day 4 â€“ Exploring Objects in JavaScript

## Overview

On Day 4, we delve into the world of objects in JavaScript. Students will learn about creating objects, accessing properties, and methods. We will also discuss the significance of objects in organizing and structuring data in a program.

- **6:30 PM to 8:30 PM**: Lecture with interactive code-along segments (includes a 10-minute break)
- **8:30 PM to 9:30 PM**: Breakout workshop session

## Detailed Schedule

### 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM: Fundamentals of Objects in JavaScript

**Introduction to Objects (10 minutes):**

- Start with an explanation of objects as collections of key-value pairs.
- Highlight the use of objects to represent real-world entities and data structures.

**Creating Objects (15 minutes):**

- Show how to create an object literal with `{}`.
- Discuss properties and methods, differentiating between data properties and functions within an object.

**Accessing Object Properties (15 minutes):**

- Teach how to access properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
- Explain when to use bracket notation (e.g., with property names that are not valid identifiers).

**Object Methods (15 minutes):**

- Define methods as functions that are properties of an object.
- Show how `this` keyword can be used within methods to refer to the object itself.

**Modifying Objects (15 minutes):**

- Discuss adding, modifying, and deleting properties from an object.
- Explain how objects are mutable and the implications of this mutability.

### 7:30 PM - 7:40 PM: Break (10 minutes)

### 7:40 PM - 8:30 PM: Deep Dive into Objects

**Nested Objects (15 minutes):**

- Introduce the concept of objects within objects and how to access nested properties.

**Iterating Over Objects (15 minutes):**

- Teach how to iterate over an object's properties using `for...in` loop and `Object` methods.

**Objects and Arrays (15 minutes):**

- Discuss the relationship between objects and arrays.
- Show examples of arrays of objects and how to work with them.

**Wrap-Up and Day's Recap (10 minutes):**

- Recap the session's content.
- Open the floor for any questions and discuss how objects tie into the broader JavaScript landscape.

### 8:30 PM - 9:30 PM: Breakout Workshop Session

**Object Manipulation Exercises:**

- Students practice creating objects, accessing and modifying properties, and writing methods.
- Provide exercises tailored to reinforce the day's learning objectives.
