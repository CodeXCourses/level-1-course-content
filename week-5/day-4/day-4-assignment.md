# Homework for Week 5: Day 4 - Introduction to GitHub Pages and Static Site Deployment

## Instructions:

After an informative lecture on deploying websites using GitHub Pages, it's time to put your knowledge into practice and prepare for the next class.

Part 1: Deploy Your Website

    Choose a Repository: Select one of your existing repositories with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that you want to deploy as a website. If you don't have one, create a new repository with a simple webpage.

    Enable GitHub Pages: Go to the repository's settings on GitHub and configure GitHub Pages to publish your site. You can choose to publish from the main branch or create a dedicated gh-pages branch.

    Share the Live URL: Once your website is live, share the URL to your website in the repository settings with your instructor. If you're not sure how to find the URL, feel free to ask for help.

Part 2: Continuous Deployment Practice

    Make a Change: Modify your website by adding new content, updating existing content, or improving the design. Make sure these changes are reflected in the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

    Commit and Push: Commit your changes and push them to your repository on GitHub.

    Observe Live Update: Visit your live website URL and observe how the changes are automatically reflected without any manual intervention. Take a screenshot of the updated webpage.

Part 3: Best Practices and Custom Domain

    Document Your Workflow: In a text file (e.g., workflow.txt), briefly describe your experience deploying your website with GitHub Pages and any challenges you faced.

    Reflect on Best Practices: Write a paragraph about the importance of maintaining clear folder structures and using .gitignore files to optimize your website deployment.

    Optional Challenge: Research how to set up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages website (if you have one) and list the steps you would take to implement this feature.

Submission:

Submit your homework by pushing any changes made to your repository and your documentation file (e.g., workflow.txt) to your GitHub repository. Ensure that your updated website is accessible and that your documentation file provides insights into your experience.
