# Practice for JavaScript

## Day 1

It will be very important to test every change you make. If you make a change that doesn't work, figure out why, or just UNDO and start again. DO NOT go to the next step if something isn't working. You mistakes will compound and make it impossible to continue!

At each step, Add, Commit, Push when you have it working. This way you will have a checkpoint to come back to.

You may use

    git checkout script.js

to delete all changes in script.js since the last Commit, and start over from that point.

### Setup

Fork and Clone the repo at

https://github.com/rmccrear/javascript-practice-1-jan-2024

Open it in VSCode. Be sure to open Chrome side by side with VSCode. Be sure to open the Dev Tools in Chrome to the Console to see the errors. This will be especially important since you should run the code at every change you make. Be very careful about the changes you make. Don't be afraid to undo or start over if you get lost or don't know why your code is broken!

### Tasks

For the following tasks

1. create a button with an event listener function
2. make sure the button works!
3. copy and paste the guessing game into the event listener function
4. modify the guessing game (change the message. change the number)
5. when you win, change the document (change a color, change the background)
6. when you lose, change the document, as well (change a color, change the background)
7. add bootstrap to your page to make it look nicer!

When you finish write down three things...

1. What does your function do?
2. What is/are its input(s)?
3. What is its result (its output or effect)?

When answering these questions think about things such as changing a color on the screen, accepting a number or a string, its internal logic, and so on.

### Turn in

Remember to Add, Commit, Push often!

You won't need to turn this in today. Turn it in after the third day's work is done.

## Day 2

Now we will do some work with pure JavaScript functions in Node.js. We'll work in Replit. As a bonus, you can add your functions back to your HTML page.

### Setup

Go to this Replit and fork it (This is different from GitHub. You will just click the Fork Button in Replit and begin work in your browser. No need to clone this one to your computer or use VSCode.)

### Tasks

Follow the tasks listed as TODOs in the code.

Bonus: Copy and paste your code from Replit back into a new file in javascript-practice-1-jan-2024 in VSCode and make it run when you click on a button.

### Turn in

Add a link to your Replit Repl to your README in javascript-practice-1-jan-2024.

You will turn this in after we finish Day 3.
