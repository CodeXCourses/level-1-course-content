# Homework for Week 5: Day 2 - Deep Dive into Git: Cloning, Committing, and Syncing Changes

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce understanding of cloning, committing, and syncing changes in Git.

## Instructions

After an insightful class about the Git commit cycle and synchronization, it's time to put your knowledge into practice and prepare for the next class session.
[Git Cheat Sheet](https://dev.to/vishnuchilamakuru/git-cheatsheet-1oaj)

Part 1: Commit Cycle Mastery

    Staging Changes: Take a file from your previously forked and cloned repository, make a modification to it, and stage this change (you created a reflections.md yesterday, so lets add on to that). Maybe add a good resource you have found while learning Git.

    Writing Meaningful Commit Messages: Write a meaningful commit message that describes the change you made. Remember, a good commit message is concise and informative, helping your future self and collaborators understand the change.

    Commit Your Change: Commit the change with your meaningful message.

Part 2: Synchronization Challenge

    Push Your Commit: Push the committed change from your local repository to your remote forked repository on GitHub.

    Remote Change: After you've pushed your change, generate a simple text file in the REMOTE repository on GitHub, and name it synchronization.txt.

    Pull the Remote Change: Use Git to pull the change you made on our remote repository to your local repository. Make sure the new file appears in your local repository.

## **To show you have properly pulled down your synchronization.txt take a screenshot of your local files after pulling down your remote repository and put the screenshot into your file structure BEFORE you do your final push for submission.**

Part 3: Reflect and Share

Write a brief reflection on your experience with the commit cycle and synchronization inside your synchronization.txt. Include any challenges you encountered and how you resolved them. Also, describe any insights gained from the collaborative aspects of Git synchronization.

Submission:

Submit your homework by pushing the committed changes and your reflection to your forked repository on GitHub. Ensure that your changes are clearly visible in your repository, and your reflect and share answer is in a text file (e.g., synchronization.txt) and your screenshot is present.

After checking to ensure your files were properly pushed to your forked repository, submit the link to your forked repository in the card with the label "Your work", and click on the "+ Add or create" button. Within that dropdown, click "Link," and attach your link. Click the submit button.

In the next class (Day 3), we will discuss any challenges faced during the synchronization process and dive deeper into collaboration using Git. Be ready to share your experiences!
