# Homework for Week 5: Day 2 - Deep Dive into Git: Cloning, Committing, and Syncing Changes

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce understanding of cloning, committing, and syncing changes in Git.

## Instructions:

After an insightful class about the Git commit cycle and synchronization, it's time to put your knowledge into practice and prepare for the next class session.

Part 1: Commit Cycle Mastery

    Staging Changes: Take a file from your previously forked and cloned repository, make a modification to it, and stage this change.

    Writing Meaningful Commit Messages: Write a meaningful commit message that describes the change you made. Remember, a good commit message is concise and informative, helping your future self and collaborators understand the change.

    Commit Your Change: Commit the change with your meaningful message.

Part 2: Synchronization Challenge

    Push Your Commit: Push the committed change from your local repository to your remote forked repository on GitHub.

    Remote Change: After you've pushed your change, generate a simple text file in the remote repository on GitHub, and name it synchronization.txt.

    Pull the Remote Change: Use Git to pull the change your classmate made to your local repository. Make sure the new file appears in your local repository.

Part 3: Reflect and Share

Write a brief reflection on your experience with the commit cycle and synchronization inside your synchronization.txt. Include any challenges you encountered and how you resolved them. Also, describe any insights gained from the collaborative aspects of Git synchronization.

Submission:

Submit your homework by pushing the committed changes and your reflection to your forked repository on GitHub. Ensure that your changes are clearly visible in your repository, and your reflection is in a text file (e.g., reflection.txt).

In the next class (Day 3), we will discuss any challenges faced during the synchronization process and dive deeper into collaboration using Git. Be ready to share your experiences!
