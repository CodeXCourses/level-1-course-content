# Homework for Week 5: Day 3 - Collaborative Workflows in Git: Branching, Merging, and Conflicts

Instructions:

Following the in-depth lecture on Git branches and the merging process, it's time to put your knowledge into practice and prepare for the next class session.

Part 1: Branching Mastery 

    Create a Feature Branch: In your forked and cloned repository, create a new branch named "feature-yourname" where "yourname" is your own name or a chosen identifier.

    Make a Minor Change: Inside your feature branch, make a minor by creating a new text file (e.g. name this file branching-merging.txt). You can put whatever content you want inside the file.

    Prepare for Merge: Commit your change with a meaningful message, and be ready for a merge operation.

<!-- !! UNSURE OF HOW WE WANT TO DO THIS PORTION, IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE PARTNERS?? I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER APPROACH  -->

Part 2: Conflict Resolution Challenge

    Create a Conflict: Ask a classmate to perform the same steps but make a different change in the same file you modified.

    Merge Your Changes: Attempt to merge your feature branch into the main branch. You will encounter a merge conflict. Document the steps you take to resolve the conflict.

    Resolve the Conflict: Manually resolve the conflict in the file by choosing which changes to keep. Ensure your final change reflects a combination of both your change and your classmate's change.

Part 3: Reflect and Share

Write a brief reflection (in your branching-merging.txt) on your experience with branching and resolving merge conflicts. Include any challenges you faced during conflict resolution and how you reached a resolution. Reflect on the importance of good communication and teamwork in such situations.

Submission:

Submit your homework by pushing the committed changes, conflict resolution, and your reflection to your forked repository on GitHub. Ensure that your changes and the resolved conflict are clearly visible in your repository, and your reflection is in a text file (e.g., branching-merging.txt).

After checking to ensure your files were properly pushed to your forked repository, submit the link to your forked repository in the card with the label "Your work", and click on the "+ Add or create" button. Within that dropdown, click "Link," and attach your link. Click the submit button.

Remember, Git is an essential tool for teamwork, and practice is key to mastering it.
