# Week 5: Day 3 - Terminal Mastery and Git Basics

Instructions:

Today's assignment is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on practicing terminal commands, and the second part involves basic Git operations including creating a repository, cloning, making changes, and pushing updates.

## Part 1: Terminal Command Practice

- **Directory Navigation and File Creation**:

  - Open your terminal.
  - Navigate to your Desktop using `cd Desktop`.
  - Create a new directory named `GitPractice` using `mkdir GitPractice`.
  - Navigate into this directory with `cd GitPractice`.
  - Create a new file named `notes.txt` using `touch notes.txt`.
  - List the contents of the directory using `ls`.

- **Take a Screenshot**:
  - After executing the above commands, take a screenshot of your terminal showing the commands used and the resulting directory contents.

## Part 2: Git Repository Creation and Modification

- **Create a New GitHub Repository**:

  - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `GitPractice`.
  - Initialize the repository with a README.

- **Clone and Modify**:

  - Clone your newly created repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-URL>`.
  - Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
  - Move the `notes.txt` file into this directory.
  - Add some text to `notes.txt` about what you learned in class today.
  - Add the screenshot of your terminal to the repository.

- **Commit and Push**:
  - Stage your changes using `git add notes.txt` and `git add <screenshot-file-name>`.
  - Commit your changes with a meaningful message using `git commit -m "Added notes and terminal screenshot"`.
  - Push your changes to the GitHub repository using `git push`.

## Submission:

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your `notes.txt` file and the terminal screenshot are visible in your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.

This assignment helps reinforce your understanding of terminal commands and basic Git operations, as well as the process of pushing updates to GitHub.
