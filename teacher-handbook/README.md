## Breakout Rooms

Breakout rooms are useful parts of the class and can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on your plan. Here are some ideas on how to use breakout rooms in your class.

### 10-minute breakout rooms

After demoing a topic or a procedure, have students breakout and do pair programming in groups of 2-4 students. Be sure that there is at least one student willing and able to share their screen! Keep them short and timed so that they don’t break down into time wasting. After the session is over, debrief students on what problems they had, how far they got in the process, and if they haven’t finished, what they plan to do next. Have at least one group present the work they did in the breakout room. The purpose of this is to give a hands-on experience to students and to review and cement the topics presented in class while it is still fresh.

### Individual breakout rooms

This can be useful if the students are working on a project of their own. It may be at the end of the week or the end of the Pathway (capstone). They will work away on their code, and a teacher or TA will drop by once an hour to check in. The teacher/TA can ask to do a mini code review, ask what they did, what they are planning, and what roadblocks are in their way. Not all students are willing to share their issues with other present. It will also make sure students are accountable for what they produce in the hour.

## Other learning tools
