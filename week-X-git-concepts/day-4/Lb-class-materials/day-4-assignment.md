# Week 5: Day 4 Assignment - Deploying with GitHub Pages

## Objective

Practice deploying a static site using GitHub Pages, starting with a `README.md` and then transitioning to a basic HTML website.

## Instructions

This assignment is divided into two main parts: deploying a `README.md` file using GitHub Pages and then creating and deploying a basic HTML website.

### Part 1: Deploying README.md on GitHub Pages

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:

  - If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub named `MyStaticSite`.
  - Initialize the repository with a `README.md`.

- **Deploy README.md Using GitHub Pages**:
  - In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
  - Set the source for GitHub Pages to the `main` branch.
  - Once deployed, visit the provided URL to ensure your `README.md` is live.

### Part 2: Transition to HTML Deployment

- **Develop a Basic HTML Website**:

  - Clone your repository to your local machine.
  - Create an `index.html` file with basic HTML content (e.g., a brief introduction about yourself or a topic of interest).
  - Add and commit your changes locally.

- **Deploy Your HTML Website**:
  - Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
  - Verify that GitHub Pages now serves your `index.html` instead of the `README.md`.
  - Visit the GitHub Pages URL to ensure your HTML page is live.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure both your `README.md` and `index.html` are visible in your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub Pages site in the "Your work" card.
