# Week 5: Day 4 â€“ Deployment with GitHub Pages

## Session Outline

Focus: Deep dive into deploying static sites using GitHub Pages, starting from contributing to an open-source project, followed by creating and deploying a new project, and addressing common deployment issues.

## Objectives

1. Contribute to an open-source project as a practical introduction to GitHub workflows.
2. Create and deploy a basic website using GitHub Pages, emphasizing the ACP (Add, Commit, Push) process.
3. Identify and resolve common issues encountered when deploying with GitHub Pages.

## Key Concepts

### Part 1: Open Source Contribution

- **Introduction to Open Source**: Explain the importance of contributing to open-source projects.
- **Hands-On Exercise**: Guide students through contributing to the provided open-source repository, following instructions in the `README`.

### Part 2: Starting a New Project

- **Project Initialization**: Create a new GitHub repository with a `README.md` and MIT license.
- **Local Setup**: Clone the repository, and build out the website (3 HTML pages, 1 CSS file, 1 JS file).
- **Deployment Workflow**: Emphasize the ACP process and deploy the project to GitHub Pages.

### Part 3: Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

- **Common Pitfalls**: Discuss issues like incorrect file paths (e.g., `/page-2.html` vs `page-2.html`), improper nesting of `index.html`, and organizing HTML files in a single folder.
- **Additional Pitfalls**: Cover other potential issues like file naming conventions, case sensitivity in URLs, and the importance of having a clear file structure.
- **Problem-Solving Strategies**: Teach how to debug and resolve these issues, possibly with breakout room activities.

## Hands-On Exercise: Deploying on GitHub Pages

- **Initial Exercise**: Deploy a `README.md` using GitHub Pages.
- **Advanced Exercise**: Clone the repository, add an `index.html`, and deploy it.
- **Observation**: Notice the transition from `README.md` to `index.html` on the GitHub Pages site.

## Breakout Rooms: Troubleshooting Practice

- **Objective**: Work in groups to troubleshoot and successfully deploy static sites.
- **Focus**: Practice the ACP process and address common GitHub Pages deployment issues.

## Conclusion

- **Recap**: Overview of deploying static sites using GitHub Pages.
- **Practical Applications**: Discuss how these skills apply in real-world scenarios.
- **Preview of Day 5**: Prepare for consolidating learnings and the final project.

**Note for Instructors**: Encourage students to experiment and personalize their projects. Be prepared to assist with GitHub Pages-specific issues and emphasize the importance of a clear, well-organized codebase for successful deployment.
