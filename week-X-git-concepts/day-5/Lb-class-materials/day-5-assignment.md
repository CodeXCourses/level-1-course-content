# Week 5: Day 5 Assignment - Full Project Deployment

## Objective

Apply the week's learnings to create, enhance, and deploy a full project on GitHub Pages, using local and remote repository management along with web content enhancement.

## Instructions

This assignment involves creating a full project, enhancing it with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and deploying it on GitHub Pages.

### Part 1: Create and Enhance a Local Repository

- **Create a New Local Repository**:

  - Create a new directory on your local machine for your project (e.g., `MyFullProject`).
  - Initialize a Git repository in this directory.

- **Add Web Content**:

  - Create an `index.html` file with a basic web page structure.
  - Optionally, add CSS or JavaScript files to enhance your web page.
  - Add and commit your changes to your local repository.

### Part 2: Link and Push to a Remote Repository

- **Create a Remote Repository on GitHub**:

  - Create a new repository on GitHub named `MyFullProject`.
  - Do not initialize it with a `README.md`, `.gitignore`, or `license`.

- **Link Your Local Repository to GitHub**:

  - Use the `git remote add origin [remote repository URL]` command to link your local repository to GitHub.
  - Push your local changes to the remote repository with `git push -u origin main`.

### Part 3: Deploy on GitHub Pages

- **Enable GitHub Pages**:

  - In your GitHub repository settings, enable GitHub Pages.
  - Set the source to the `main` branch.

- **Verify Your Deployment**:

  - Ensure that your web content is correctly displayed on the GitHub Pages site.
  - Visit your GitHub Pages URL to confirm the deployment.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Your GitHub repository should contain your web content and be deployed on GitHub Pages.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository and your GitHub Pages site in the "Your work" card.
