# Homework for Week 4: Day 5 â€“ Consolidation and Recap of JavaScript Fundamentals

This assignment will test your understanding of variables, functions, objects, and arrays. You'll be working with data and applying various operations.

## Instructions

   1. Setup Environment
      - Open your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
      - Create a new folder called JS_Review_Assignment on your local machine.

    2. Create Files
      - Inside the JS_Fundamentals_Assignment folder, create two files:`scripts.js` and `index.html`.
      - Note that we won't be working with the HTML DOM in this assignment.

    3. JavaScript Tasks

        In the scripts.js file, perform the following tasks:

            Variables:
                Create a variable called name and assign your name as a string.
                Create a variable called age and assign your age as a number.
                Create a variable called isStudent and assign it a boolean value (true or false).

            Functions:
                Create a function named calculatePerimeter that calculates and returns the perimeter of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters, length and width. **if you are unsure of how to find the perimeter of a rectangle, google it!**
                Create a function named reverseArray that takes an array as a parameter and returns a new array with the elements reversed. You can use built-in methods or create your own logic.

            Objects:
                Create an object named person with properties for name, age, and isStudent. Use the variables you defined earlier to populate the object.

            Arrays:
                Create an array called fruits with at least three different fruit names.
                Use an array method to add a new fruit to the beginning of the array.
                Use an array method to remove the last fruit from the array.

     4. Console Logs
        Log the results of your functions and the content of your objects and arrays to the console. For example:

    ```javascript

    console.log("Name:", name);
    console.log("Area of the rectangle:", calculateArea(5, 10));
    // ... more console logs ...```

    5. Submission
        - Zip the "JS_Review_Assignment" folder.
        In the card with the label "Your work," click on the "+ Add or create."
        Within that dropdown, click "File," and attach your zipped folder.
        Click the submit button.
