# Homework for Week 4: Day 2 â€“ Exploring Arrays and Their Fundamental Operations

Arrays are an extremely powerful data structure in JavaScript. Today you learned about the fundamentals of arrays and how to use them. Now it's time to put your knowledge to the test. Understanding how to utilize arrays and their methods will be crucial to your success as a developer.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

    - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
    - Create a new folder named `JS_Day2_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

    - Create a new file named `arrays.js` and `index.html`.
    - Note that VScode will automatically detect file types based on their extension such as `.html` or `.js`.
    - VScode will automatically color code your JavaScript file to make it easier to read.

3. **index.html**

    - Generate a generic HTML page, you are not required to bring in any elements.
    - JavaScript runs in the browser, so we need to link our JavaScript file to our HTML file.
    - Ensure you connect your `arrays.js` file to your `index.html` file. (use a script tag like this `<script src="arrays.js"></script>`)
    - **You will be utilizing your dev tools to see your console logs you create below! (hint: right click on your page and click inspect, then click on the console tab in case you need a refresher!)**

4. **arrays.js**

    - You will be creating 3 arrays to hold data for any type of information you want.
    - 1 array will be an array of strings.
    - 1 array will be an array of numbers.
    - 1 array will be an array of mixed data types.
    - You will need to console log the values of your areas just as you saw in lecture today along with implementing the methods you learned to see how you can manipulate the data in your arrays.
    - Ensure you utilize the `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()` methods along with the `length` property.
    - **Console log the values of your arrays after you have manipulated them to see how they have changed at each stage.**
    - Ex:
    `console.log(myArray);`
    `console.log(myArray.length);`
    `console.log(myArray.push('new value'));`
    `console.log(myArray);`

5. **Submission**

    - Zip the "JS_Day2_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
      **or**
    - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "JS_Day2_Assignment".
