# Bootstrap Practice

Re-make one of your projects in Bootstrap.

Choose an old theme from Week 2 HTML or Week 2 CSS and re-create the idea with Bootstrap. Be creative. You may have a completely new idea after looking at the Bootstrap documentation and examples.

## Setup

Clone Repo and update the README with your plan. In the README, add the files you wish to include. As you come up with idea, add them to the readme as a milestone for yourself. Check them off as you go. Commit changes after each milestone you set for yourself.

## Task

Be creative and open to new ideas as you explore the possibilities Bootstrap offers.

You do *not* need to write your own CSS, but you may if you wish.

You must include:

* three pages
* a list-group
* a grid ("row" and "col")
* a card
* two buttons with JavaScript event listeners
* one more component of your choosing
* at least one Bootstrap Utility class
* all pages linked together with anchor tags

**Bonus** Here are some more ideas from bootstrap to include to make your page look better. All of these may be implemented with Bootstrap classes

* padding
* margin
* border
* float

## Turn in

**Important** Update your README's Roadmap so that all the items have been checked off with an x.

Update your Acknowledgements section to include any websites you visited or people you worked with. Give credit to those how helped you virtually or in person. These links will be useful when you want to review something later.

Updating your readme is a low-effort way to 10x the quality of you GitHub profile. No one wants to see a bunch of blank README's when they click through from your profile. Keep it up-to-date for when you share with the world!

If you remember how, deploy with GitHub pages, and include that link on your README or in the About section of the Repo.

Submit the link to your GitHub repo (not the link to the live page.)
