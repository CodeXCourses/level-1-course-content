## Day 1

This is a multi-day assignment.

### Setup

Fork the repo for this week's practice.

### Task

Create files called buttons.html, buttons.css, and buttons.js.

In buttons.html, add boilerplate html, head, and body. Add an h1 and p tag. You may add header, body, and footer if you wish.

Add a button with an ID attribute.  

In buttons.js, use a function to make something happen when the onclick event is triggered. (For example, you could use an alert or change the textContent or style one of the elements on the pageâ€”like changing the background color.)

Make at least 5 buttons in total with different IDs. Add a function to each so each button causes something to happen onclick.

If you have time, style the buttons using a class (.) in CSS. You can also target individual buttons with id (#) or another class. Start by modeling your button design on the Bootstrap buttons, but be as creative as you like!

### Turn it in

Wait until the third day of the assignment to turn it in.
