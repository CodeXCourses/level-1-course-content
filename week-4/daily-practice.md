## Day 1

This is a multi-day assignment.

### Setup

Fork the repo for this week's practice.

### Task

Create files called buttons.html, buttons.css, and buttons.js.

In buttons.html, add boilerplate html, head, and body. Add an h1 and p tag. You may add header, body, and footer if you wish.

Add a button with an ID attribute.  

In buttons.js, use a function to make something happen when the onclick event is triggered. (For example, you could use an alert or change the textContent or style one of the elements on the page—like changing the background color.)

Make at least 5 buttons in total with different IDs. Add a function to each so each button causes something to happen onclick.

Update the README...

* include your name and email address
* add an x to the Roadmap of what you completed
* add any webpages you used or found useful to the Acknowledgements
* Update the section that says "This is a website about..." so that says what topic or theme you chose for this page. (i.e. sports, food, cars, etc.)

### Turn it in

Wait until the third day of the assignment to turn it in.

## Day 2

We will practice using CSS classes to apply the same style to many elements at once. We will start by making our own CSS class. Then will use Bootstrap classes to style the buttons.

### Setup Day 2

Continue using your repo from Day 1.

Create the new files styled-buttons.html, styled-buttons.js, styled-buttons.css.


### Task Day 2

* Make 5 more buttons, and put them in styled-buttons.html.
* Style ONLY ONE of the buttons with an ID in styled-buttons.css.
* In styled-buttons.css, change the ID to a class. (Hint: In CSS IDs use the # symbol. Classes use the . symbol)
* In styled-buttons.html use the class to style all 5 buttons.
* Open Chrome to the Bootstrap documentation at https://getBootstrap.com
* Include Bootstrap in your page via CDN.
* Search the Bootstrap documentation for Buttons.
* Make another 5 buttons. Style them with different classes provided by Bootstrap.
* Review: Put an event listener on at least two of the buttons so that they respond to clicks. (Hint: you still need IDs in HTML to access them in JS.)

Bonus:

* Put the first 5 buttons in one div, and the other 5 buttons in another div. Use Bootstrap to float them right or left in the div. (Hint: use clear on the divs.)
* create another class that modifies the Bootstrap buttons in some way. Add the class to the button and observe the result.
* Put event listeners on more of the buttons!

## Turn in Day 2

Update your README's Roadmap so that all the items have been checked off with an x.

Update your Acknowledgements section to include any websites you visited or people you worked with. Give credit to those how helped you virtually or in person.

Wait until Day 3 to turn in this repo.

## Day 3

Today, you will explore the possibilities that bootstrap offers. You'll make a few Bootstrap components by reading the documentation on getBootstrap.com and creating them yourself. You will use Bootstrap classes to vary the appearance. Finally, you'll make at least two buttons that respond to onclick events. Don't forget to update the README.

### Setup Day 3

Make these files: list-group.html, grid.html, card.html, and card.js. Add boilerplate HTML, and include Bootstrap from a CDN. You don't need your own .css files, since you will use Bootstrap to style everything!

Update your README's about section and roadmap to include the files you just created.

Remember to Add, Commit, and Push after completing each step.

### Task Day 3

Re-use the repo from the first two days. Remember to set up your screen so that your VS Code editor is on the left, and Chrome is on the right so you can see your changes as you write. This will make it easier to experiment and correct mistakes.

You will make three new pages to demo three different bootstrap components.

All the documentation and examples for creating beautiful Bootstrap layouts and designs are on getBootstrap.com. You may find yourself spending more time reading the docs than you do coding! Hit the thunderbolt icon ⚡ on the examples for a live demo in StackBlitz.

#### 1. list-group Task

**In list-group.html** Make a list-group with at least five items. Add another bootstrap class to customize its appearance in some way. (For example, list-group-item-action or disabled)

#### 2. grid Task

**In grid.html** Make a grid of at least two rows and three columns. Use "row" and "col" classes on div elements. (You can make more rows or columns if you want!) You can put a paragraph and button or any other elements you want as content. (You could even put in a card if you are ambitious.)

#### 2. card Task

**In card.html** Make a Card with a card-body, card-title and card-text classes. Also include a button in the card. Then, create a second card in the same style as the first with different content.

Add an event listener that responds to a click event to each button in the cards.

**Card Bonus :** Add a third card, and make a three column grid design using "row" and "col".

**Card Bonus 2:** Add an image to the cards.

### Turn in Day 3

**Important** Update your README's Roadmap so that all the items have been checked off with an x.

Update your Acknowledgements section to include any websites you visited or people you worked with. Give credit to those how helped you virtually or in person. These links will be useful when you want to review something later.

Updating your readme is a low-effort way to 10x the quality of you GitHub profile. No one wants to see a bunch of blank README's when they click through from your profile. Keep it up-to-date for when you share with the world!

If you remember how, deploy with GitHub pages, and include that link on your README or in the About section of the Repo.

Submit the link to your GitHub repo (not the link to the live page.)
