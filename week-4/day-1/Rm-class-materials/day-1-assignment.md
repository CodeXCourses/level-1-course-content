# Homework for Week 4: Day 1 â€“ Diving into JavaScript Fundamentals and Variables

Welcome to the world of JavaScript! Today you learned about the fundamentals of JavaScript and how to use variables. Now it's time to put your knowledge to the test.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

    - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
    - Create a new folder named `JS_Variables_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

    - Create a new file named `script.js` and `index.html`.
    - Note that VScode will automatically detect file types based on their extension such as `.html` or `.js`.
    - VScode will automatically color code your JavaScript file to make it easier to read.

3. **index.html**

    - Generate a generic HTML page, you are not required to bring in any elements.
    - JavaScript runs in the browser, so we need to link our JavaScript file to our HTML file.
    - Ensure you connect your `script.js` file to your `index.html` file. (use a script tag like this `<script src="script.js"></script>`)
    - **You will be utilizing your dev tools to see your console logs you create below! (hint: right click on your page and click inspect, then click on the console tab in case you need a refresher!)**

4. **script.js**

# Instructions  

## Introduction

You will use JavaScript to add CSS to HTML Elements.

You must make at least 5 HTML elements on your page.

Then go into the `script.js` file and set the CSS on the five HTML elements using JavaScript.

You will follow a two step process for setting the CSS.

1. Select the HTML element and store it in a variable.
2. Set the property on the style of the element.

Then repeat for the next HTML element.

## Detailed instructions

1. Make five HTML elements in the file `index.html`
2. Add an ID attribute to each HTML element so you can select it. 
3. Go into the file `script.js`.
4. Select the first HTML element you want to change and store it in a variable. (You can use any variable name you want. You can also re-use variables.)
5. Set at a style property on the HTML element using JavaScript.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for the five other HTML elements.

### Bonus

These are some extra challenges, if you'd like to try. (optional)

- Can you change the text of the element?
- Can you cause an element to change in response to a click (search for `onclick`)?
- Can you create a button that resets the element back to it's original state?
- Can you make a button that toggles a style back and forth?
- Try choosing different variables names for each element you select.
  
5. **Submission**

    - Zip the "JS_Variables_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
      **or**
    - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "JS_Variables_Assignment".
