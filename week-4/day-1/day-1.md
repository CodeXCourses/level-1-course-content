# Week 4: Day 1 â€“ Diving into JavaScript Fundamentals and Variables

## Overview

Tonight's session will be entirely dedicated to a deep dive into JavaScript, with a strong focus on variables, types, and basic user interaction through code-along examples. Students will be coding alongside the instructor for the entire duration. Here's the updated plan:

- **6:30 PM to 8:30 PM**: Lecture with code-along segments (includes a 10-minute break)
- **8:30 PM to 9:30 PM**: Breakout workshop session

## Detailed Schedule

### 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM: Introduction to JavaScript and Variables

**Introduction and Developer Tools (10 minutes):**

- Quick tour of the browser developer tools console.
- Recap the use of the console for JavaScript debugging and execution.

**Introduction to Variables (15 minutes):**

- Discuss the 'use strict' directive.
- Explain the role of variables in JavaScript.
- Demonstrate variable declaration with `let` and best practices.
- Showcase the common mistake of creating an unintended global variable due to a typo.

**Variable Inspection and Output (5 minutes):**

- Code along on how to use the developer tools to inspect variables.
- Introduce the `console.log` method to display variable values.

**Constants and Immutable Variables (5 minutes):**

- Introduce `const` and try to reassign to illustrate the resulting error.
- Discuss why `var` should be avoided and how to substitute it with `let` in most cases.

**Understanding Primitive Data Types (25 minutes):**

- Dive into numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`.
- Discuss dynamic typing and demonstrate type coercion with live code examples.

### 7:30 PM - 7:40 PM: Break (10 minutes)

**A brief pause before the next engaging code-along session.**

### 7:40 PM - 8:30 PM: Deep Dive into Variables and Data Types

**Alerts, Prompts, and Document Writing (15 minutes):**

- Demonstrate how to use `alert`, `prompt`, and `document.write` for basic user interaction.

**String Manipulation (15 minutes):**

- Explore string concatenation, escape characters, and the importance of template literals.
- Live coding to concatenate a list of variables using different methods.

**String Properties and Methods (20 minutes):**

- Discuss string indexing and the `length` property.
- Go through important string methods like `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, and others as time allows.

**Wrap-Up and Day's Recap (10 minutes):**

- Sum up the session's content, reinforcing the key takeaways.
- Prepare students for the workshop activity and what to expect in the breakout rooms.
- Introduce the concept of arrays as a teaser for Day 2.

### 8:30 PM - 9:30 PM: Breakout Workshop Session

**Workshop and Collaboration:**

- Organize students into small groups for the workshop.
- Focus on tasks that reinforce the lecture content in a hands-on manner.
- Provide detailed instructions and support through a separate markdown file.

**Conclusion:**

- Gather feedback from the groups and address any lingering questions.
- Offer concluding remarks and share instructions for the next class.

**Note:** The detailed assignment and guidelines will be provided in the markdown (md) file. Make sure your development environment is set up for a fully interactive code-along experience.
