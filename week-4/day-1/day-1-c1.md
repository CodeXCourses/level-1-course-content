# Week 4: Day 1 â€“ Diving into JavaScript Fundamentals and Variables

## Format: Morning (2 hours)

**Purpose:** Apply what we know about the DOM and introduce JavaScript as a tool to manipulate the DOM. Also, learn out to set up a `script.js` file and import it into HTML.

---

## Hour 1: Introduction to JavaScript and Variables

### Lecture (15 minutes):

- Touch upon the JavaScript aspects encountered during the Bootstrap week.
- Discuss variables as the foundation for storing and managing data in scripts.
- Introduce three key topics...
  - Selecting an Element with JS
  - Storing an element in a VARIABLE
  - Setting a property of Style on an Element
- Skip `let`, `const`, and the legacy `var` for now. Use global variables. Let's pretend we are teaching in Python for the time being.
- Canva whiteboard (link)[https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxWHvFgTE/ffKm0utKPEUutOvY-Y8qcQ/edit?utm_content=DAFxWHvFgTE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton]
- Briefly recap the browser developer tools' console and its use for JavaScript.

### Hands on Learning (15 minutes):

1. First demo selecting an element in a random website in console. (Could be Canva.)
2. Create Replit, invite students to create any element they choose with an id. (This is keep the id attribute idea fresh in their minds.)
3. Demo selecting an element from the Replit. (Pop the Replit into a new Tab.)
4. Demo altering a style property.
5. Request all students pop the Replit into a new tab, open Dev Tools>Console and type 1+1.
6. Request all students select an element. (Ask for thumbs up. Troubleshoot)
7. Request all students assign element to a variable and set a style property.

Break.

### Hands on Learning 2 (15 minutes):

1. Demo doing this process in `script.js`.
2. Note that this will not be dynamic. (It will be on page load, but we will add dynamism later.)
3. Ask students to use JS to change the style properties of the elements they created.

## Introduce Assignment

Some students at this point may be struggling to keep up. Note that JavaScript week will involve less typing and be more conceptual. This will be a time to allow students to catch up on old work, and to give advanced students a chance to learn about bonus topics and ask questions further afield. We'd like students to feel like they have a chance to get caught up. Emphasize that we build in catch up time into our syllabus. (Consider changing week 5 to Git and Catch-up Week?)

Run through the assignment. It is similar to the Hands on Learning section. The difficulty will be writing the code without encountering too many bugs, and debugging when they arise.
