# Week 4: Day 3 – Understanding and Leveraging Functions in JavaScript

## Overview

Today's focus is on functions: what they are, how they work, and why they're so central to programming in JavaScript. We'll start by connecting functions to what students already know—built-in JavaScript functions and methods. This session will enhance students' abilities to read and write their JavaScript functions and understand the use of functions they'll encounter in everyday coding.

- **6:30 PM to 8:30 PM**: Lecture with interactive code-along segments (includes a 10-minute break)
- **8:30 PM to 9:30 PM**: Breakout workshop session

## Detailed Schedule

### 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM: Fundamentals of Functions in JavaScript

**Introduction to Functions (10 minutes):**

- Start with an explanation of what functions are and their importance.
- Relate to known functions like `alert()`, `prompt()`, and string methods like `.toUpperCase()`.
- Emphasize how built-in functions prevent us from having to write complex code from scratch.

**What Functions Look Like (10 minutes):**

- Discuss the syntax of a function.
- Show the structure of a function with `function functionName() {}`.
- Highlight the `()` which indicates that it is a function.

**Functions We've Already Seen (15 minutes):**

- Explain that `alert` and `prompt` are built-in functions in JavaScript.
- Highlight that methods such as `.slice()` on strings are functions attached to string objects.

**Demonstrating `.slice()` with Indexing (10 minutes):**

- Code block for demonstrating `.slice()` with indexing will go here.

**Invoking Functions (Multiple Times) (15 minutes):**

- Show how to invoke or call the `sayHello()` function from earlier multiple times.
- Explain what happens if you forget the parentheses (function will not execute).
- Demonstrate multiple invocations with different parameters to show flexibility.

**Closing the Hour:**

- Summarize the importance of functions.
- Open the floor for any questions.

### 7:30 PM - 7:40 PM: Break (10 minutes)

### 7:40 PM - 8:30 PM: Going Deeper with Functions

**`function` Keyword vs. Variable Declarations (10 minutes):**

- Clarify the difference between `function` keyword and variable declarations using `let` or `const`.
- Discuss hoisting and how function declarations are hoisted but not variable declarations.

**Function Expressions (10 minutes):**

- Explain a function expression by assigning a function to a variable.
- Compare and contrast declaration vs. expression.

**Array of Functions (10 minutes):**

- Show that functions can be stored in arrays and invoked later.

**Arrow Functions (10 minutes):**

- Introduce arrow function syntax.
- Show how to convert an arrow function to a traditional function.

- Encourage sticking with the `function` keyword for now, for simplicity.

**Wrap-Up and Day's Recap (10 minutes):**

- Recap the session's content.
- Prepare students for the workshop activity and encourage them to practice writing their functions.

### 8:30 PM - 9:30 PM: Breakout Workshop Session

**Function Exercises:**

- Facilitate a workshop where students create their functions to solve specific problems.
- Provide exercises
