# Homework for Week 4: Day 3 â€“ Diving Deep into Functions

 In today's lecture, you learned about the fundamentals of functions and how they can be used to create reusable code blocks. Now it's time to put your knowledge to the test.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**
    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Create a new folder named JS_Functions_Assignment on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**
    - Create a new file named script.js and index.html.
    - Note that VScode will automatically detect file types based on their extension, such as .html or .js.
    - VScode will automatically color code your JavaScript file to make it easier to read.

3. **index.html**
    - Generate a generic HTML page; you are not required to bring in any elements.
    - JavaScript runs in the browser, so we need to link our JavaScript file to our HTML file.
    - Ensure you connect your script.js file to your index.html file using a script tag like this: `<script src="functions.js"></script>.`
    - You will be utilizing your dev tools to see your console logs you create below! (hint: right-click on your page and click inspect, then click on the console tab in case you need a refresher!)

4. **functions.js**

    - A good practice when creating JavaScript files is to start your file with a 'use strict'; statement. This will help you avoid common mistakes and write better code.

    - Create a function named calculateAreaOfRectangle that takes two parameters: length and width. Inside the function, calculate the area of a rectangle using the formula area = length * width and return the result.

    - Create another function named convertFahrenheitToCelsius that takes one parameter: temperatureInFahrenheit. Inside the function, convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9 and return the result.

    - Create a third function named greetUser that takes one parameter: name. Inside the function, create a greeting message that includes the user's name and returns it.

    - Call each of these functions with appropriate arguments, and log the results to the console.

5. **Submission**
    - Zip the "JS_Functions_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work," click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown, click "File," and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
        **or**
    - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "JS_Functions_Assignment."
