### Lab 1 Part 1 Setup

(If you are on phone, remember, you cannot fork in the GitHub app. You must log in to GitHub in your browser.)

1. On the GitHub website fork this repository: https://github.com/rmccrear/week-2-lab-1-part-1-may-2024
2. In Replit or VSCode, clone the repository (In Replit click "Import from GitHub"; in VSCode click "Clone Git Repository")
3. Look at the README file, add your name to "authors", and add an [x] to the first item on the roadmap.

### Instructions

4. Have a look at cats.html. (You will want to re-type this in dogs.html.)
5. Start with the H1 tag and first p tag.
6. Add your own text about dogs in the H1 and P tags
7. Add in em and strong tags in the first P tag
8. Try adding an article tag with an H2 and two P tags.
9. Add your own text to those tags. (You may use lorem ipsum)
10. (optional) Make another HTML file about a new topic that interests you. Include the ARTICLE, H1, H2, P, EM and STRONG tags.

### Turn in

Complete the [X] marks on the README.

After each step in the Instructions, use git to create a commit.

Push with `git push origin main` to sync with GitHub.

Keep your work safe on Replit, GitHub or on your own computer. You will turn in it together with day two's work.

### Bonus and Extension

You may choose to do a bonus or extension. These are optional activities that will help push your knowledge and skills further. Give them a try if you have the time!

**Bonus** (more tags): look at all the HTML tags on w3 Schools. Which would be easy to use? Which are challenging? Choose a few to add as elements on your page.

**Extension** (deprecated tags): on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML). Look for deprecated tags. Research why they are no longer used. Dig up the history behind why these tags fell out of use. Create a webpage of your findings using the deprecated tags and their replacements.
