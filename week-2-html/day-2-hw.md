### Lab 1 Part 2 Setup

(If you are on phone, remember, you cannot fork in the GitHub app. You must log in to GitHub in your browser.)

1. On the GitHub website fork this repository: https://github.com/rmccrear/week-2-lab-1-part-2-may-2024
2. In Replit or VSCode, clone the repository (In Replit click "Import from GitHub"; in VSCode click "Clone Git Repository")
3. Look at the README file, add your name to "authors", and add an [x] to the first item on the roadmap.

### Instructions

4. Have a look at frogs.html. (You will want to re-type this in fish.html.)
5. Create a file called fish.html
6. Start with the H1 tag and first p tag. Add your own text about fish in the H1 and P tags
7. Add three images with img tags from pexels.com to your document
8. Add three links with a tags to external websites (like: https://bing.com)
9. Get creative! You now know a lot of HTML tags and attributes. Try them out or search out new ones!
10. Check to make sure your HTML tags open and close. Check to make sure your HTML tags are in the BODY of the file, not in the HEAD.

### Turn in

Complete the [x] marks on the README.

After each step in the Instructions, use git to create a commit.

Push with `git push origin main` to sync with GitHub.

Keep your work safe on Replit, GitHub or on your own computer. Turn in the GitHub repository or the link to your Replit. **If you can't "git" it to work, just upload your files here.** It's OK. We know git is hard!

Check the **rubric** on Moodle for information about grading.
