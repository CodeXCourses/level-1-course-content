<h2>Lists</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating an unordered list(ul) tag will give you bulleted lists by default</li>
    <li>A fun short hand with HTML is when creating li tags you can type li*3 and hit TAB/ENTER which will prompt your VS code to generate 3 li tags</li>
    <li>Give it a try! You can do this for all types of tags if you need multiple of them in a specific area</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You can create nested lists by indenting a ul tag</li>
        <li>And then generate an li tag</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>We can also create ordered lists by using the ol tag!</li>
    <li>We still use the li(listed item) tag in the ol element</li>
      <ol>
        <li>ol tags can be nested as well! </li>
        <li>Try experimenting with nesting lists to see what you can create!</li>
      </ol>
  </ol>


  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Our First Column</th>
        <th>Our Second Column</th>
        <th>Our Third Column</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Tables can be difficult to understand.</td>
        <td>Be patient with yourself and just keep experimenting.</td>
        <td>You can make some cool stuff!</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The td tags in each tr tag will represent the first item in that row.</td>
        <td>In our last row I will write my favorite trilogy of movies in order of appearance!</td>
        <td>Feel free to try and make something that showcases something you like.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring</td>
        <td>LOTR: The Two Towers</td>
        <td>LOTR: The Return of the King</td>
      </tr>
