## Lab 2 JavaScript, lists and tables

This lab will consist of two parts. Turn the two parts in together when finished.

**Part 1:** https://github.com/rmccrear/week-2-lab-2-part-1-may-2024

**Part 2:** https://github.com/rmccrear/week-2-lab-2-part-2-may-2024

### Lab 1 Part 2 Setup

(If you are on phone, remember, you cannot fork in the GitHub app. You must log in to GitHub in your browser.)

1. On the GitHub website fork this repository: https://github.com/rmccrear/week-2-lab-2-part-2-may-2024
2. In Replit or VSCode, clone the repository (In Replit click "Import from GitHub"; in VSCode click "Clone Git Repository")
3. Look at the README file, add your name to "authors", and add an [x] to the first item on the roadmap.

### Instructions

4. Have a look at javascript-the-hard-way.html for an example.
5. Create a new HTML file. You may choose to call it anything you wish, just don't include spaces.
6. Create at least one script tag in the HTML file.
7. Inside your script tag, write JavaScript code that writes text into the HTML document. Write at least 10 things using document.write().
8. Check to make sure all your tags close and that all your display code is in the BODY of the document.

### Turn in

Complete the [x] marks on the README.

After each step in the Instructions, use git to create a commit.

Push with `git push origin main` to sync with GitHub.

Keep your work safe on Replit, GitHub or on your own computer. Turn in the GitHub repository or the link to your Replit. **If you can't "git" it to work, just upload your files here.** It's OK. We know git is hard!

Check the **rubric** on Moodle for information about grading.

### Bonus and Extension

You may choose to do a bonus or extension. These are optional activities that will help push your knowledge and skills further. Give them a try if you have the time!

**Bonus**: Create several more SCRIPT tags in different places on you page. Be creative, but be sure to close your SCRIPT tag and don't write HTML code within a SCRIPT tag.

**Extension**: Read about [document.write on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_doc_write.asp). Look at the examples and try them out yourself. Can you find something you can do in JavaScript that you couldn't already do in HTML? Read about [JavaScript output on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp) for other ways to use JavaScript to modify a page.
