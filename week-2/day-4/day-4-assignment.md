# Homework for Week 2: Day 4 â€“ Mastering Flexbox, Introduction to CSS Grid, and Responsive Design Basics

Lecture today went deeper into the Flexbox layout technique, introduced another powerful layout tool (CSS Grid), and laid the foundation for responsive web design. This assignment will encourage you to use the Flexbox properties you learned today as well as introducing the CSS grid properties.

**For extra practice: Similar to the CSS diner you did yesterday there is the [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). This will NOT be a part of your assignment today but a great tool to use if you are struggling with understanding.**

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

- Open **Visual Studio Code**
- Create a new folder named `CSS_Day4_Assignment` on your local machine.

2.**Create Files**

- Inside the `CSS_Day4_Assignment` folder, create 2 files: an HTML file named `index.html` and a CSS file named `styles.css`.

3.**index.html**

- Setup your `index.html` with HTML elements that you can manipulate with the Flexbox and CSS Grid properties.
- The content of these elements can be whatever you want as long as they are appropriate.

4.**styles.css**

- This will be where most of your experimentation will go for this assignment.
- Manipulate your generated elements on `index.html` with the Flexbox and CSS Grid properties.
- A couple examples of things to do could be: create a 3 x 3 grid using the CSS Grid properties, test out manipulating block elements with Flexbox properties, or come up with something you think would be fun to create with these properties.
- Utilize some of the relative units discussed in class (`em`, `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`). These will help you understand how you can make your webpage responsive to different screen sizes.
- Refer to your notes from lecture and feel free to see some examples of how to setup the CSS grid can be found at [w3schools - CSS grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp).

5.**Expectations**

- Do your best to experiment with most of the properties you learned today.
- We don't expect you to be a master of any of these properties, but we hope you get comfortable enough to experiment with them and see how they interact with each other in your future projects.

6.**Submission**

- Zip the "CSS_Day4_Assignment" folder.
- In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
- Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
- Click the submit button.
