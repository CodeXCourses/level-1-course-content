# Homework for Week 2: Day 1 - Introduction to CSS and Styling Basics

The goal of this assignment is to expand off your HTML knowledge from last week and introduce you to how CSS interacts with HTML to produce styled web content.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `CSS_Day1_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Inside this folder, create 2 files: an HTML file named `index.html` and an html file named `table.html`.

3. **Generating index.html structure**

    - Setup your `index.html` similar to how you have in previous assignments this week, feel free to experiment and do something new with what you have learned as well!
    - Ensure you set up a nav bar to navigate between your 2 pages!
    - You can utilize [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) as a way to look at different HTML elements and how they are used.

4. **Generating table.html structure**

    - Setup your `table.html` with a simple nav bar to navigate back to the home page and a table element with at least 3 columns and 3 rows.
    - This table will be styled in the next step.

5. **CSS**

      - We want you to practice using both the internal and inline styling methods in this assignment.  
      - For your `index.html` file, use the inline styling method to style the background color, change font colors, alter font-families, font-weight, and font-size. Use the material you learned today. Try to style at least 3 different HTML elements on this page in different ways!
      - For your `table.html` file, use the internal styling method to style your table and nav bar. Feel free to add more elements to this page, just make sure all styling is done in your internal stylesheet!

6. **Submission**

    - Zip the "CSS_Day1_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
