# Homework for Week 2: Day 5 â€“ Finalizing CSS Concepts, "CSS Diner" Review, and Integrative Project

You made it to the end of week 2! This assignment will test your knowledge of all the CSS concepts you have learned this week. You will be creating a webpage that will be styled using the CSS properties you have learned this week. You will also be using the HTML elements you have learned to structure your page.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `CSS_Day5_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

    - Inside this folder, create 3 files: 2 HTML files named `index.html` and `page.html` along with a CSS file named `styles.css`.
    - We want to continue to practice navigating between pages along with utilizing the external CSS stylesheet method.

3. **Generating index.html/page.html structure**

    - Setup your `index.html` and `page.html` with an idea in mind.  Whether this be a home page that leads to a mock product you want to display on your `page.html`, personal portfolio page, or a welcome page that leads to a blog page, it is up to you! Create something you are interested in seeing come to life!

4. **Generating styles.css structure**

    - We want you to utilize the different styling methods you have learned this week in this assignment.
    - For your `index.html` and `page.html` files, try to utilize everything you have learned! Design them in a way that you find interesting, change the colors of your background and your fonts, generate a grid using the CSS Grid properties, and use Flexbox to manipulate the positioning of your elements.
    - Experiment and have fun with this assignment! This is your chance to show off what you have learned over the last two weeks!
