# Week 2 Day 3

Attributes

Lecture on anatomy of a tag.

First example: font tag with style attributes

id, src, href

use JS to access id. Set textContent by id. Strings and variables.

a tags with href to id

a tags with href to an external website

a tags with href to a local file


## Hour 1

Review Bird's Eye View of HTML.

Review anatomy of an HTML Element. Stress the opening, closing and content sections of the element.

Introduce attributes on button and textarea (others may be OK). These are obvious and easy to understand. Demo if desired or if students would like.

(Optional) Introduce the font element. Stress that this is an old deprecated way, but it is a good illustration of attributes. Try in Replit. Each person can write their name, one letter to a line. Add a font change for each letter.

## Hour 2

Introduce img and a tags. Do a breakout room for one or both.

## Hour 3

Workshop time

## Sticking points and Blockers

### Attributes

Stress that the attributes go in the opening tag. It may take a bit of time to grok how to construct an element.

Start with simple attributes like disabled on the button. Move on to obvious key/value pairs like row and col on a textarea. Or even the deprecated tag `font`.

It may be a good idea to leave urls in attributes for the next day.


### URLs

Students may have a hard time understanding URLs and relative URLs.  

Some issues that may come up in this regard.

* needed to check the precise file name and path in a relative URL can 
* understanding how to find an image on the web, and that the URL represents the image file that the browser needs to download from.
* understanding the file system on the remote server and the folders/directory structure.

You may even want to review or even do a hands on review of URLs from week 1.
