# Mini Labs

This week, we will have a multi-day lab.

On day 1, make a repo called html-practice.

We will use this repo for three days. You won't need to make a new repo. You will re-use this one and add to it each day.

## Day 1

Typographic, semantic, and nested tags

### Setup (5 min)

Fork the repo for today, so you have your own copy.

https://github.com/rmccrear/html-practice-Jan-2024

Clone it to your local machine, and open it in VS Code.

Choose a topic for your page. It could be an animal, a kind of food, a sport, game, or anything else you can think of. Use this topic to fill in content as you build your page.

Update the README file to reflect your own plans.

### Task

1. Create a file called typography.html
2. Add an html tag and head and body tags.
3. Add a title tag in the head.
4. Add a h1, h2, and p tags.
5. Add an article tag.
6. Nest another h1, h2, and several p tags inside the article tag.
7. Update the Roadmap section in the README file to reflect your changes.

**bonus** Do one or more of the following tasks to extend your knowledge and skill.

* Make several more article tags to represent "articles" about your topic on a blog. Put h1, h2, and p tags inside them.
* Add inline tags like strong, del, and em to the paragraphs. (Q: what happens if you add them to a header tag?)
* Research (by google search) "semantic html". Add more semantic html tags to your page.

### Turn in

You don't need to turn in this assignment today. You will continue working on it for the next few days, adding something each day. Turn it in on day 3.

## Day 2

### Lists

We will learn how to make HTML Elements that require multiple types of tags nested within each other. The Ordered List Element requires the ol and li tags. You will make a few ordered lists in this task.

Continue in the same repo you used last time and use the same topic as you had before. You will make lists of things related to your topic. For example, the best 5 of something. Your favorite 5 of something, and so on.

### Setup (5 min)

You will using the same repo as you used for yesterday's task. Open VS Code to  the folder containing yesterday's work. (It should already contain a file called typography.html)

Make a file called lists.html. Add html, head, body, and title tags to it.

### Task (30 min)

1. Add an h1, h2, and p tag to the top to introduce your topic.
2. Add an ordered list of something related to your topic (top 5, etc.)
3. Add two more ordered lists.
4. Update the Roadmap section on the README to reflect your changes.

**bonus** Do one or more of the following tasks to extend your knowledge and skill.

* Research and create a nested list in your HTML document.
* Research and create another type of list in your HTML document.
* Wrap your lists in a section tag and add an h2 and a p tag within the section to describe your list.

### Turn in

You don't need to turn in this assignment today. You will continue working on it for the next few days, adding something each day. Turn in in on day 3.

## Day 3

attributes and links to other pages

You will create an index.html page. It will contain links to other pages, including the pages you just created.

You will also create an image tag.

### Setup

You will using the same repo as you used for yesterday's task. Open VS Code to  the folder containing yesterday's work. (It should already contain a file called typography.html and one called lists.html)

Create a file called index.html with html, head, title, and body tags.

### Task

1. Add an h1, h2, and p tag. Add an id attribute to each of them.
2. Create an anchor tag (a) that contains a hyper-reference to https://google.com and has the content "Link to Google".
3. Create an anchor tag with a link to your local newspaper, (or any other website you visit frequently.)
4. Create and anchor tag to the two other pages you made in the last two days: typography.html and lists.html
5. Add an image to your website with the src tag and the alt tag.
6. Update the Roadmap section on the README to reflect your changes.

**bonus** Do one or more of the following tasks to extend your knowledge and skill. You may need to do some research on your own to find the answer.

* Add a bit of JavaScript that changes something about one of the elements on the page, accessing it by ID.
* Add text to some p tags with lorem ipsum generator. Give the p tags id attributes. Create anchor tags that link to the p tags using their id.
