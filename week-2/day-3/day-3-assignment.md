# Week 2 Day 3 â€“ Advanced CSS: Positioning, Advanced Selectors, and Layout Introduction

Today you were introduced to CSS positioning/display properties and utilizing advanced selectors. This assignment will be broken up into 2 different parts. The first part will be the completion of the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) game which will help with understanding the advanced selectors. The second part will be a small webpage to practice the position and display properties.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `CSS_Day3_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Inside the `CSS_Day3_Assignment` folder, create 2 files: an HTML file named `index.html` and a CSS file named `styles.css`.
   - We will be navigating toward using the external stylesheet method going forward, this is because it is the most common practice in the industry.

3. **CSS Diner**

   - Navigate to the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) game.
   - Complete all 32 levels of the game.
   - Take a screenshot of **all the completed levels** and attach it to your submission in the root directory like you did yesterday for your box model screenshot.
   - Utilize the TAs and your classmates if you get stuck! This is a great opportunity to practice your collaboration skills.

4. **index.html**

    - Setup your `index.html` with at *LEAST* 9 elements.
    - You will be applying one of the positioning/display properties to each element.
    - **These elements do not need to be complex, feel free to use simple elements with any amount of you want. An example could be some `<p>` with your name, or `<div` holding a small sentence. These are not meant to be difficult to generate, just create some simple ones you can manipulate with the properties learned today**
    - Don't worry if they are overlapping or not positioned correctly, we just want you to practice using these properties so you can see how they interact with your webpage.

5. **styles.css**
    - As mentioned above each element will need to be manipulated with one of the positioning/display properties.
    - You will be applying CSS positioning to these elements, so you will have 1 with `position: static`, 1 with `position: relative`, 1 with `position: absolute`, 1 with `position: fixed`, and 1 with `position: sticky`.
    - Ensure you have your live server open as you apply these position properties so you can see how they interact with each other. Change the border color of each element to make it easier to see.
    - The remaining elements will be using the `display` property, so you will have 1 with `display: block`, 1 with `display: inline`, 1 with `display: inline-block`, and 1 with `display: none`.
    - Try setting distinct borders to each element with different colors so you can see how they interact with each other. (Remember to use your class/id selectors to make your life easier!)
    - Feel free to experiment with the Flexbox properties you learned as well, however we will be diving deeper into these tomorrow!

6. **Submission**
      - **This is your first larger homework day, this assignment is broken into the two portions with the CSS Diner game and the webpage. Please make sure you submit the screenshot of CSS diner levels with your webpage for this assignment.**
      - Zip the "CSS_Day3_Assignment" folder.
      - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
      - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
      - Click the submit button.
        **or**
      - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "CSS_Day3_Assignment".
