# Instructions  

## Introduction

Now it's time to use all the skills we learned so far to make a website.

It won't look like much, but when we learn CSS and Bootstrap, we will be able to make it look great! For now, focus on structure.

## Requirements

You must use the following tags.

* h1
* h2
* p
* a (with href attribute)
* img (with src attribute)
* ul, ol
* li
* table (**bonus**)
* tr (**bonus**)
* td (**bonus**)
* th (**bonus**)

## Detailed instructions

Take a look at the wireframe we did in class. Your job will be to recreate it to the best of your ability. (If you wish to change the topic, that is fine. Just follow the format.)

1. Your website will need three pages. Home, About, and Menu.
2. The pages should all have links to each other.
3. Each page should have a photo relevant to the topic.
4. Use height and/or width attributes on img tags to set the size.
5. Each page should have h1, h2 and p tags.
6. At least one page should have a list.
7. Each page should have at least one of: em, strong, or del tags.
8. Research an include a `footer` tag at the bottom of each page. (For example: this can include your &copy; )


*Room for creativity*: You may change the topic, name, or text to something that sparks your interest. You may also make other changes as you see fit as you work. But, the design is there to give you an idea of what the final project should look like, approximately.

For example, if you don't want to sell food, you can change the page from Menu to something else.

(Just be sure to use all the tags, and include links, images, lists, and a table.)

**bonus** 

* Add a table tag with table, tr, td, and th
* Add id tags to some elements
* Change some of the tags in the Console using JavaScript. Take a screenshot of the chances.
