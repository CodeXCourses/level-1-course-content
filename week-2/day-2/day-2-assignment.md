# Homework for Week 2: Day 2 â€“ Expanding CSS Knowledge: Fonts, Borders, and the Box Model

We are continuing to build on our CSS knowledge from yesterday. Today we will be diving deeper into the box model, text styling, and understanding browser defaults.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `CSS_Day2_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Inside this folder, create 2 files: an HTML file named `index.html` and a CSS file named `styles.css`.
   - We will be navigating toward using the external stylesheet method going forward, this is because it is the most common practice in the industry.

3. **Generating index.html structure**

    - Setup your `index.html` similar to how you have in previous assignments this week, feel free to experiment and do something new with what you have learned as well!
    - You will need to generate some HTML elements to style in your CSS file, so make sure you have a few elements to work with.

4. **Generating styles.css**

      - We will want you to utilize the different styling methods you have learned today in this assignment.
      - For your `index.html` file, use the external styling method to style the background color, change font colors, alter font-families, font-weight, font-size, width, height, margin, borders, and :hover. Use the material you learned today. Try to style **at least** 3 different HTML elements on this page in different ways!

5. **The Box Model**

      - Once you have some elements generated on your `index.html` page, we want you to experiment with the box model properties you learned today.
      - Try to use the `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, and `border` properties to alter the dimensions of your elements and see how they interact with each other.
      - For this portion of the assignment, you will need to screenshot of your dev tools showing the box model of a selected element. You can do this by right-clicking the page to "inspect" the page or by using the shortcut `ctrl + shift + i` on Windows or `cmd + option + i` on Mac. Once you have the dev tools open, you can select an element and it will show you the box model of that element. You can then screenshot this and attach it to your submission.
      - This screenshot will be added as a file in the root of your project where your `index.html` and `styles.css` files are located.

6. **Submission**

    - Zip the "CSS_Day2_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
