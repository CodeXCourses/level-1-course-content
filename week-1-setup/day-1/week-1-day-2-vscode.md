# Week 1 Day 2

Goals

* Get VSCode installed
* Open VSCode
* Use VSCode to create a file and a folder
* Prove to yourself that an IDE is just a file editor--all the file create in VSCode also exist in the filesystem
* Remind students without a laptop (on phone) to watch and ask for help when they get their chromebook later in the month. They may practice with Mimo in the meantime.

## Overview

Goal install VSCODE

NOTE: this day will require extra help from TA's. Ask TA's to be present and help in Breakout rooms. If TA's time is limited, you can do the presentation all at once, and have the last one or two hours be an install fest with TA's to help.

### Week 1 Day 2 Hour 1

10 min - MIMO REVIEW See if students have questions about Mimo, ask about progress. "How far have you gotten in Mimo?" "Thumbs up if you finished level 1" "Level 2?" "Level 3?" "Did you learn something interesting?" "Was anything confusing?" "What would you like to learn next?"

10 min - VSCODE PRESENTATION Start slides. Do Demo of creating a text file and quick tour of VSCode. Emphasize that they don't need to use all the features right away. Just give them an idea of what is possible. Prove to them that the files created in the IDE are on the computer's filesystem. You can find and open them like a normal text file.

20 min - Create Breakout rooms: Ask students to try and install VSCode, create a folder, make a file.

Note: Take a screenshot of Breakout Room instructions and post it to Slack.

5 min - Review questions and break

10 min - VSCODE PRESENTATION Review creating a folder and file. Show how to make an HTML file. Create a button tag like in Mimo. Go to the filesystem and double click to open in browser. Bring browser side by side with editor. Emphasize that you need to SAVE and RELOAD browser to get the changes to show up. (Some students will think they need to double click on the file every time they make a change.)
