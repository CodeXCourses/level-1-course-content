# TODO Updates

## Reflection

The GitHub lab is too hard for one day, but the VSCode isn't so bad.

Plan on splitting the GitHub day into two parts. One: fork and clone. Two: push and sync

Possibly putting VSCode/Replit earlier in the week to leave room for fork/sync later in the week.

Update for new procedure for Replit and phone users:

Phone users:

* Fork repo in BROWSER not GitHub APP.
* In Replit click "Settings" next to Clone from URL
* Use Shell in Replit to sync with GitHub
