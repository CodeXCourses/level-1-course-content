# Teaching Notes

## Pacing


## Assignments

The first week will have many assignments. This will help us determine who needs help with logging in and navigating Moodle. Students who don't have records of logging in to Moodle can be contacted by counselors to get onboard and navigate to the first few assignments.

## Turning in

We accept work in many form. GitHub, Replit Repl link, and zip file. If students are not set up with GitHub, they will still be able to turn in work another way.

## Grading repos and code

Use the Download All button and our Python script to clone all assignments at once. Open the containing folder in VSCode, for convenient access.

## Note on tools

TA's and teachers will be most familiar with VSCode. We will also support Replit workflows for Chromebook users and Phone users. Teachers and TA's should practice using Replit on both PC and Phone so they can assist students. 

### Why Replit?

Replit is a powerful tool that can be used to build all the projects we will build in the class. It also has a good mobile app that allows students to code efficiently on a small keyboard. It has access to a shell. And it is free to use (but not deploy). It is easy to get started an most students have no problem using it right away, especially with a single page app. They will need some training to get started, but after showing them how it works, it is fairly easy an requires no setup.

Replit quirks:

* When opening a new Repl, tell students not to choose "HTML, CSS, JS (Auto Refresh)" it will be hard for beginners to use. Use the "HTML, CSS, JSS" template to start.
* External websites do not load in the WebFrame, only relative URLs. For links you create to external websites, you will need to Open in New Tab.
* The address bar in the WebFrame can be a little confusing. "Run" will sometimes take you back to the index.html page, and sometimes leave you on a different page. (You can set which page you are on by typing the relative URL in the WebView's address bar and clicking the arrow button.)

**Replit alternatives:** Glitch (much simpler, but no Phone App), CodeSpaces (Great git integration and VSCode, no Phone Interface), StackBlitz (very good git integration, looks like VSCode, no Phone Interface)
