# Capstone Project

You will build a website showcasing the skills and technologies you learned in this class so far. The website should be a personal or profesional website that with information about you, your background, your skills or hobbies, and anything else you'd like to include.

After completing your project, you should schedule an appointment with an evaluator. You will present your project and the topics you learned. You'll also discuss the roadblocks your faced as you worked on your project and how you overcame them. Show both your website, and the code behind it. Your evaluator is interested in seeing both the final result, and also process you went through to build it.

* HTML - tags like p, h1, h2, a, img, and table.
* CSS - properties like color and padding, selection with class and id
* Bootstrap - bootstrap components like card, row, and col
* Javascript - buttons with callbacks, for-loops and if-statements
* GitHub - store your code Be sure to commit as you work!
* GitHub pages (deploy your site live!)
* A README.md file with your wireframe


** For JavaScript be sure to include variables, if statements, and for loops. **

** For HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, you can refer to your previous assignments for those weeks. You will find everything you need there! If you are missing a few concepts from previous assignments in your capstone, that is not a deal-breaker. Use as much of what we learned as you can fit in! **

Here are a few examples of capstone projects to give you some ideas.

## Day 1

Complete your Lo-Fi WireFrame.

A lo-fi wireframe is a diagram of how your website will look. It shows your layout and how the pages connect to each other. It will not show the exact text, colors or images you plan to use. Here is an [example](https://miro.com/templates/low-fidelity-wireframes/) of what it might look like. You may use canva, miro, or pen and paper to make your lo-fi wireframe.

## Day 2

Repo with Readme and Roadmap

Create your Repo, and start your README file. You may copy the template from a previous project. Be sure to update it, and pay special attention to the Roadmap section.

Include a picture of your wireframe in your README.

Once you have done your README, start coding!

## Day 3

**Start Coding:** Make at least 3 html files, 3 js files, and 3 css files.

Create the boilerplate and hookup the css and js and bootstrap to the html files.

Make at least 3 commits!

Try to "Finish" at least one page of your project. (It doesn't have to be in its final form, but it should be "good enough"). Include at least one event listener in JavaScript.

## Day 4

Make a plan for the rest of the project. Try and set mini-goals for yourself. When should you have the second page done? The third? When do you want you JavaScript done? Make a list for yourself. Update the Roadmap section of your README to included these goals.

Once you've done this, start work on one of your goals!

## Day 5

Make an appointment next week to present your project to your TA. Try to get it done early, so you have a chance to make revisions if needed.

Do a walk-through of your project with your teacher or TA today. Say what you've done, what you are stuck on, and what you are planning for today.

## Days 6-9

Continue to work on your roadmap.

Each day, meet with a classmate, TA or teacher. Say what you've done, what you are stuck on, and what you are planning for today.

Meet with your TA for your Capstone eval sometime this week.

## Day 10

Present to the class.

Start with a 30 second introduction of yourself plus a 30 second elevator pitch for your project. Go into a walk through of your project, starting with your README. (3-5 min) You may discuss the project itself, the tech used, and also the process you went through to get to where you are. End by sharing what you did, what problems you encountered, and what you would have done differently.

(If you haven't passed your capstone evaluation, show us what you have done so far, and what you plan to do next.)
