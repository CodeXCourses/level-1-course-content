# HTML Document Setup and Structure Assignment

The main goal of this assignment is to familiarize students with the basics of setting up and structuring an HTML document.

## Steps:

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
   - Create a new folder named `HTML_Day1_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create File and Structure**

   - Inside this folder, create a new file named `index.html`.
   - Start with the HTML5 document structure. Begin with the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration followed by the root `<html>` element.
   - Create a `<head>` section containing the meta charset declaration and a `<title>` tag. The title should be "My Personal Introduction".

3. **Body Content**

   - Within the `<body>` section:
     - Add an `<h1>` tag with your name.
     - Add an `<h2>` tag titled "About Me".
     - Below this, add a `<p>` tag containing a brief introduction about yourself.
     - Conclude with an `<h2>` tag titled "My Favorite Quote" followed by a `<blockquote>` containing your favorite quote and the author.

4. **Preview and Test**

   - Use the live-server extension in VS Code to preview your webpage in a browser.
   - Ensure everything looks as expected.

5. **Submission**
   - Zip the "HTML_Day1_Assignment" folder.
   - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
   - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
