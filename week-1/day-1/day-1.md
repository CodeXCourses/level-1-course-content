# Week 1: Day 1 â€“ Intro to HTML with Developer Tools & VS Code

## Format: Morning (2 hours)

**Purpose:** Start with a review of developer tools and VS Code to ensure everyone is on the same page, then dive into the basics of HTML. Show practical applications of tools in real-world coding scenarios.

## Hour 1: Review of Developer Tools and VS Code

### Dev Tools & VS Code Overview (30 minutes):

- Brief recap of Chrome Dev Tools:
  - Purpose and importance.
  - Basic features.
- Brief recap of VS Code:
  - Purpose in web development.
  - Installation process.
  - Essential features: creating files, opening folders, and installing extensions.
    - Create folder on desktop
    - Open folder in VS Code
    - Create index.html
    - Create a folder in VS Code
    - Nest a Folder within that folder to show how it displays 2 empty folders nested
    - Create files within the folders to show how that behaves
    - Set up Prettier, set as default code formatter. Select options format on save, format on paste.
    - Show extensions for themes.
    - Show better comments extension (optional)
    - Turn on Auto Save

### Practical Application (30 minutes):

Ask the class to follow along.

- Install the `live-server` extension in VS Code.
- Create a basic HTML file named "index.html".
- Add a simple "Hello, World!" message.
- Launch the `live-server` to view the HTML file in a browser.
- Use Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the "Hello, World!" message.
- Discuss how this simple setup simulates a real-world development environment.

## Hour 2: Introduction to HTML

### Basics of HTML (25 minutes):

- Explain the building blocks of HTML documents.

  - What is HTML? HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
  - It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of `elements`
  - [Show anatomy of HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#anatomy_of_an_html_element)

  - Open VS Code and type out the starter code
  - Discuss structural tags: paragraphs, divisions, headers, and footers.

  - Show typography tags: strong, and italics.

### Interactive Session (20 minutes):

- Students create their own basic HTML file in VS Code (or Replit if they encounter issues with VS Code).
- They replicate the "Hello, World!" setup and experiment with adding paragraphs, headers, and basic formatting.

### Contingency for Troubleshooting (10 minutes):

- Address common issues with VS Code setup.
- Provide guidance for using Replit as an alternative.
- Highlight the importance of flexibility in tool usage in real-world scenarios.

### Wrap-Up (5 minutes):

- Encourage students to experiment further with HTML.
- Remind them of the skills needed for the HTML badge.
- Preview what's coming up in the next session.
