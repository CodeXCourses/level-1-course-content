  <header>
    <h1>This h1 tag is inside a header</h1>
    <p>Header tag is used as a container for introductory content placed at the top of a page.</p>
  </header>

  <!-- ** nav bar with anchor tag -->
  <nav>
    <a href="test.html">Navigate to our test.html file</a>
    <p>nav tags are combined with anchor tags, the nav element is intended only for MAJOR blocks of navigation links, like you would see at the top of page to navigate to all the different areas of their website</p>
  </nav>

  <!-- ** div tag overview -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>This unordered list is contained in a div tag</li>
      <li>Div tags can be used to define a division or a section</li>
      <li>Sometimes they are used as a container to assist in styling</li>
      <li>As you learn more about HTML webpages you will see divs get used in a lot of different ways!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ** span tag -->
  <span>span tags are INLINE containers whereas divs are block level elements, they are similar in how they can be used, but have that very distinct difference in how they are applied.</span>

  
  <!-- ** inline styling showcase -->
  <p style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Inline styling with CSS can allow you to easily style one specific part of your page!</p>

  <!-- **id and class -->
  <p id="my-id">This paragraph has an id of "my-id"</p>
  <p class="my-class">This paragraph has a class of "my-class"</p>
  <p>ids and classes are essential when trying to target specific elements when using an external CSS sheet. This is something we will cover in the future!</p>
