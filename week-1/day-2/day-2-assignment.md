# Day 2: Personal Webpage Layout with Navigation

The goal of this assignment is to further reinforce the understanding of HTML elements and attributes by creating a personal webpage layout with navigation.

## Overview

Create two well formed HTML files and link them.

## New Concepts

* Linking with anchor tags
* Semantic tags like header, nav, main, footer
* HTML attributes like id class and style
* headers for each page

## Reviewed concepts

* Well formed HTML boilerplate
* Typographic tags: h1
## Instructions:

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `HTML_Day2_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Inside this folder, create two HTML files: `index.html` and `about.html`.

3. **index.html Structure**

   - Structure the document with a `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
   - In the `<header>`, add an `<h1>` with "Welcome to [Your Name]'s Website".
   - Inside `<nav>`, create links using the `<a>` tag to both `index.html` (label it "Home") and `about.html` (label it "About Me").

4. **about.html Structure**

   - Structure the document similarly to `index.html`.
   - In the `<main>`, provide a brief biography or any content about yourself.
   - Include at least one use of the attributes `id`, `class`, and `style`.

5. **Navigation Testing**

   - Ensure that both pages have a navigation bar that links to each other. Test to see that the navigation works.

6. **Submission**
   - Zip the "Day2_Assignment" folder.
   - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
   - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
   - Click the submit button.
    **or**
   - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "HTML_Day2_Assignment".
