# Week 1: Day 3 â€“ Lists, Tables, and Advanced HTML Structures

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce new HTML elements in regards to creating a table and inputting information along with the ability to create lists.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `HTML_Day3_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

   - Inside this folder, create 3 files: an HTML file named `index.html`, `lists.html`, and `table.html`.

3. **index.html Structure**

   - Structure the document with a `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
   - In the `<header>`, add an `<h1>` with "Welcome to [Your Name]'s Passion Page!".
   - Inside `<nav>`, create links using the `<a>` tag to both `index.html` (label it "Home"), `lists.html` (label it "Lists"), and `table.html` (label it "Table").

4. **Lists**

   - Create an unordered list with at least 5 items. The list should contain a nested list.
   - If you are creating an ordered list ensure you are using the correct `<ol>` and `<li>` tags. Otherwise you can generate an unordered list using the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.
   - The content of your list can be anything of your choosing, but it should be relevant to you.

5. **Table**

   - Create a table with some NEW information you are passionate about! This could be your favorite movies, books, food, games, etc. The table should have at least 3 columns and 3 rows.
   - Ensure you are properly utilizing the `<table>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>` and `<tfoot>` tags.
   - Reference back to lecture notes if you need a refresher on how to properly structure a table!

6. **Submission**
   - Zip the "HTML_Day3_Assignment" folder.
   - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
   - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
   - Click the submit button.
    **or**
   - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "HTML_Day3_Assignment".
