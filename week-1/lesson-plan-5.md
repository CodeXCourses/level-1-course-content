# Day 5 VS Code and GitHub

Purpose: Putting it all together and preparing for turning in assignments the next week.

Also, we should stress the importance of the README file.

## Hour 1

Demo workflow.

1. Fork a repo.
2. Clone the repo to local machine.
3. Add to the README.md
4. A-C-P
5. Make some changes to the HTML or JS
6. A-C-P after each one

The README can have the following sections:

* About
* Built With
* Roadmap with check marks
* Contact
* Acknowledgements

Remind students to fill in the Roadmap with check marks

You can start with a [starter repo](https://github.com/rmccrear/my-fav-things-demo)

See [Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/master/BLANK_README.md)

This can be a chance to demo a bird's eye view of HTML, CSS, and JS.

You can also use Live Share to work on this with students.

## Hours 2-3

Lab time in breakout rooms.
