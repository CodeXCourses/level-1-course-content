# VS Code intro Mini-lab

## Instructions

### Setup (5 min)

In Documents or "My Documents" create a folder called "projects". In "projects" create a folder called "vs-code-playground"

Open the vs-code-playground folder that you just created in VS Code.

### Task (20-30 min)

In VSCode, create a file with a .html file extension.

In VSCode, create a file with a .txt file extension.

In VSCode, create at least 4 more files with whatever extensions you like.

In VSCode, create a folder called img. Drag an image file into that folder.

In VSCode, create at least two more folders. Drag images into them or create files in them. (Be careful, it can be tricky to see which folder a file is in!)

### Turn-in (5-10 min)

When you turn in your work, you must also turn in a reflection of 3-5 sentences. Turn in your work and reflection in the same assignment.

**Turn in** a screenshot of VS Code showing your folders and files that you created.

**Reflection (5-10 min):** In addition to turning in your work, you must also write a short reflection on the work you did. Write 3-5 sentences telling what learned, what was difficult, and what you would do differently.
