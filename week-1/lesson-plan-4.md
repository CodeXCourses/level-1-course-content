# Day 4 Git and GitHub

We'll make sure Git and GitHub are installed and working with VS Code and the Terminal.

## Hour 1

What is git used for?

Demo of git and GitHub workflow.

## Hour 2

Walk through three steps.

1. Create a repo.
2. clone to desktop
3. ACP in VS Code/Terminal

Try to have a breakout room for each.

Have TA's on the lookout for students who need help with setup.

## Hour 3

Workshop: Create, clone, and ACP a repo on your own.

## Troubleshooting

GitHub Desktop should install git with it on Windows. It might not, so you will have to install it with git-for-windows

GitHub Desktop might be confused as to where to find Visual Studio Code on Mac if it was in Downloads, opened, then moved to Applications.
