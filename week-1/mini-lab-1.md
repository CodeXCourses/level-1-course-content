# Dev Tools/JavaScript Mini Lab

In this lab you will get familiar with JavaScript and how to execute JavaScript in the Console (Dev Tools).

Don't worry about understanding everything at this point. The goal is to have fun and make inferences.

## Instructions

### Setup (5 min)

Open your browser.

Open Dev Tools.

Open the Console Panel.

Copy the code from this gist and past it into the console. Hit the ENTER key on the keyboard. [gist](https://gist.github.com/rmccrear/e5634bee4b7345cb03096d24f76fb7bb)

Copy the code into a text editor like VSCode.

### Task (15-20 min)

Go through the code by yourself or with a partner. Above each line, make a comment guessing what each line does.

Optional Bonus: make some changes to the JavaScript. You might change the number guessed, change the message, or even think about how to implement a loop.

### Turn-in (5 min)

Copy the code with all the comments that you added.

Go to GitHub and create your own gist.

Paste the code with your comments into the gist, and turn in the link to the gist.

(If you can't figure out how to make a gist, just copy your code into the text box in Moodle.)

**Reflection (5-10 min):** In addition to turning in your work, you must also write a short reflection on the work you did. Write 3-5 sentences telling what learned, what was difficult, and what you would do differently.
