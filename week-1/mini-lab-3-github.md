# GitHub intro Mini-lab

## Instructions

### Setup (5 min)

On the GitHub website, go the the top left, and click the + icon. Create a new repository. Call it First Repo. Make sure it is Public and select "Add A Readme."

### Task (20-30 min)

In GitHub Desktop, use File > Clone Repository to clone it to your local machine. Choose a location to save it. (The default is usually OK.) Remember where you saved it!

In VSCode, open the folder you saved.

Add to the Readme file using Markdown.

Add a few files and folders, and call them what you wish.

Bonus: create html files and populate them with tags you learned in Mimo.

### Turn-in (5-10 min)

When you turn in your work, you must also turn in a reflection of 3-5 sentences. Turn in your work and reflection in the same assignment.

**Turn in** Turn in the link to the repo you created on GitHub.

**Reflection (5-10 min):** In addition to turning in your work, you must also write a short reflection on the work you did. Write 3-5 sentences telling what learned, what was difficult, and what you would do differently.
