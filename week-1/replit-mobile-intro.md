# Replit Mobile App Intro

Replit's mobile app is surprisingly good for coding a webpage. It is pretty well laid out and all of the features are there if you know where to look.

They have features like a unix shell, an editor with auto completion, git, etc.

Once you get used to the tabbed interface, its smooth and intuitive. Student will need its use to be modeled for them, but can probably get the hang of it once they see how it's done. While not idea, it can be a viable alternative for those without a laptop.

## Replit Dev Tools

Replit has an emulated Dev Tools available to inspect your project. It uses the Eruda project.

There are some limitations, but a lot is there. You can view and select elements. You can run JavaScript in the console. You can see network requests from fetch or ajax.

You can't alter HTML elements or CSS from the dev tools. You can't view network traffic of downloaded files. It is missing other advanced features of the Chrome Dev Tools.

## Replit Shell
