# Project Assignment

## Overview

You will fork the "I love cats" website from GitHub

https://github.com/rmccrear/i-love-cats-j2024

You will make any changes you like. You must change at least 3 things, and make at least 3 commits with good commit messages. 

You must also update the README.md to reflect your changes.

### Setup (5 min)

Create/Fork the "I love cats" repo on GitHub. Clone it to your local machine and open it in VSCode.

repo: https://github.com/rmccrear/i-love-cats-j2024

### Task (30 min-1 hour)

First change the README.md file to have your name instead of mine, under the Contact heading. Using git, add, commit and push with the message "update readme".

Change at least 3 things in the index.html file. You can change text, like "cat" to "dog" or add HTML tags, if you wish.

After each change make a commit. Make at least 3 commits with good commit messages indicating the changes you made. A commit message should be short and to the point - no longer than 50 characters.

Make any other changes you like. Feel free to be as creative as you want, given the time you have.

When you are finished, update the Readme section "Roadmap" to include any features you added.

**Turn in**  a link to your GitHub repo/Replit Repl.

**Reflection (5-10 min):** In addition to turning in your work, you must also write a short reflection on the work you did. Write 3-5 sentences telling what learned, what was difficult, and what you would do differently next time.
