# Project Assignment

## Overview

You will fork and modify a small website and commit the changes to GitHub. If possible, you can deploy it with GitHub Pages.

The purpose of this lab is to get you used to the process of creating a project and committing it to a repository. We will use this process every week for the rest of the course.

## Instructions

You will fork the "I love cats" website.

You will make any changes you like. You must add at least 3 HTML tags, and make at least 3 commits with good commit messages. You must also format your code, so it is properly indented.

### Setup (5 min)

Create/Fork the "I love cats" repo on GitHub. Clone it to your local machine and open it in VSCode.

### Task (20-30 min)

Add at least 3 HTML tags to the index.html file.

Make at least 3 commits with good commit messages indicating the changes you made. A commit message should be short and to the point - no longer than 50 characters.

Make any other changes you like.

**Turn in** a link to your GitHub repo/Replit Repl. If you can, try and deploy it with GitHub Pages.

**Reflection (5-10 min):** In addition to turning in your work, you must also write a short reflection on the work you did. Write 3-5 sentences telling what learned, what was difficult, and what you would do differently next time.
