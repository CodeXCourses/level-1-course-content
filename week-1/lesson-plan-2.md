# Day 2

Continue with demo from Day 1, review, and evaluate pacing.

Learn about JavaScript and the console.

## Hour 1

**10 min** Take questions, ask how students are doing.

**40 min** Review Day 1 Demo, walk through creating a webpage. Publish it via Replit or Pages. Allow students to use skills from previous day interactively as you type it out to see how each file is downloaded in the Network Panel and how they change the way the page functions.

## Hour 2

Hands-on learning

(**Optional**: cancel JS lesson and use this time for setup/install fest)

Present the guessing game code as a Gist. Allow students to copy/paste from the gist into the console. Walk through line by line and take questions.

As you walk through the code, stop for 10 min breakout rooms have students share screens and discuss how they would describe what each line does.

## Hour 3

(**Optional:** Spend this time on install fest and cancel the homework.)

**10 min** Show students how to make their own gist on GitHub. Introduce homework: to leave comments on the code guessing what each line does.

**30 min** Students work alone or in groups on commenting their code. They may also attempt to modify the code to change what it does. They should work in their gists and copy/paste into the console.

**10 min** Ask for students to share their work, and end class.

## Homework

A gist with commented JS guessing game. [gist](./demos/guessing-game-gist.js)
