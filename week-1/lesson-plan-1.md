## Hour 1

Run demo lecture.

**10 minutes** General Intro

Introduce Moodle, and assignments.

**40 minutes** Lecture (and demo if time). (Demo can spill over to next time.)

## Hour 2

**35 min** Run two or so breakout rooms with a focus on Element Selector and Network, and Console if there is time.

**15 min** During the last 15 minutes, set aside time to demo the homework.

## Hour 3

Workshop. Students must complete the assignment on Dev Tools. (Screenshot and upload.)

The rest of the time can be spent on trouble shooting setup issues.

## Evaluation

Take an informal evaluation of students as you move through the breakout rooms and answer questions. See how well they can manage their machines, install software, and absorb vocabulary terms. If you see issues, adjust Day 2's activities to include more setup time, and remove some of the content.
