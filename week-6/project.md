# Project

## Setup

Create a git repository on GitHub.

Include a README file when you create the repo.

You may include a .gitignore file if you wish. Select "Node".

You may include a license. It doesn't mater much which you choose. Note that theses licenses grant liberal rights to others to copy an re-use your work.

Clone the repo to your local machine.

Open it in VSCode.

Create an index.html file and a script.js file. (A style.css file is optional.)

Start up your Live Server and arrange your windows so you can see the results live as you type.

## Task

Create a tic-tac-toe game using HTML and JavaScript. You may use click for X and double click for O.

When you click on a spot, it will insert an X. When you double click on a spot, it will insert an O. (Hint: use textContent)

You must also include an array that will store the state of your game. This will be a series of "X", "O", and "-" characters to represent X, O and blank space. this array must be kept in sync with the board that is displayed in the DOM to the user.

### Bonus

Add a button that will check to see if there is a winner.

You don't need to check every possible way to win.

Start with checking rows, then if you have time, try adding checks for the other ways to win.
