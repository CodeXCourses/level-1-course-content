## Hour 2: Diving into Control Structures

### Introduction to `if`, `else if`, and `else` (20 minutes):

- Explain the basic structure of conditional statements.
- Showcase scenarios where different conditions lead to different code execution paths.

### Practical Application: Interactive Scenarios (25 minutes):

- Provide students with real-world scenarios where they must use comparisons and control structures to determine outcomes.
- Challenges might include validating form input, determining pricing based on user roles, or generating custom messages based on user behavior.

### Wrap-Up and Day's Recap (15 minutes):

- Sum up the key takeaways related to comparisons and control structures.
- Offer a preview of Day 2, hinting at the introduction of loops and their pivotal role in repetitive tasks.
