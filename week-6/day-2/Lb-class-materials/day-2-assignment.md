# Week 6: Day 2 Assignment - Mastering Loops in JavaScript

## Objective

Apply the concepts of `for` and `while` loops in JavaScript to solve real-world coding challenges.

## Instructions

This assignment involves implementing different types of loops to perform various tasks, demonstrating an understanding of their use cases and functionalities.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:

  - Create a new repository named `JavaScriptLoops`.
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Inside your local repository, create an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file.

### Part 2: Implementing `for` Loops

- **Array Iteration**:

  - Create an array of at least 5 elements in `script.js`.
  - Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

- **Generating Repeated Elements**:
  - Use a `for` loop to generate and log a sequence (e.g., numbers 1 to 10) to the console.

### Part 3: Exploring `while` Loops

- **Conditional Looping**:
  - Implement a `while` loop that executes as long as a certain condition is true.
  - Demonstrate a practical scenario where a `while` loop is preferable over a `for` loop.

### Part 4: Advanced Looping Concepts

- **Nested Loops**:

  - Create a nested loop structure to solve a complex problem (e.g., generating a multiplication table).
  - Log the output of the nested loops to the console.

- **Commit and Push Changes**:
  - Commit your changes to your local repository with a meaningful message.
  - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository `JavaScriptLoops` contains your `index.html` and `script.js` with implemented loop functionalities.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.
