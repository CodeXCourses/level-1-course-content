# Week 6: Day 4 â€“ Advanced DOM Manipulation in JavaScript

## Session Outline

Focus: Delving deeper into the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript, exploring various DOM selection methods, element modification, styling, and event handling.

## Objectives

1. Master different DOM selection methods: `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, and `getElementsByClassName`.
2. Learn techniques for modifying and interacting with DOM elements.
3. Understand how to apply styles to elements using JavaScript.
4. Gain proficiency in adding and handling event listeners.
