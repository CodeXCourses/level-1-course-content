# Week 6: Day 1 Assignment - Basic DOM Manipulation and JavaScript Logic

## Objective

Apply the concepts of basic DOM manipulation and JavaScript logical constructs in a hands-on project.

## Instructions

This assignment involves creating a web page that uses DOM manipulation to dynamically display results of basic JavaScript logic.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:

  - Create a new repository named `JavaScriptLogicDOM`.
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Inside your local repository, create an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file.

### Part 2: DOM Manipulation

- **HTML Setup**:

  - In `index.html`, create a `div` element with a unique ID to serve as a container for dynamic output.
  - Add a text input field and a button to facilitate user interaction.

- **JavaScript Interaction**:
  - In `script.js`, write code to create new `p` elements and append them to the container with dynamic content based on user input and logic.

### Part 3: Implementing Comparisons and Control Structures

- **User Input Logic**:
  - Implement a function that triggers when the button is clicked.
  - Use comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to evaluate the user input.
- **Control Structure Implementation**:
  - Use `if-else` statements to create different outputs based on the user input.
  - Display the results as text inside new `p` elements appended to the DOM.

### Part 4: Enhancing Output

- **Dynamic Output**:

  - Ensure the output in the DOM updates every time the user inputs a new value and clicks the button.

- **Commit and Push Changes**:
  - Commit your changes to your local repository with a meaningful message.
  - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository `JavaScriptLogicDOM` contains your `index.html` and `script.js`.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.
