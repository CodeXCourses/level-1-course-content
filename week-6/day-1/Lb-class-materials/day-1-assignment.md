# Week 6: Day 1 Assignment - Basic DOM Manipulation and JavaScript Logic

## Objective

Apply the concepts of basic DOM manipulation and JavaScript logical constructs in a hands-on project.

## Instructions

This assignment involves creating a web page that uses DOM manipulation to dynamically display results of basic JavaScript logic.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:

  - Create a new repository named `JavaScriptLogicDOM`.
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Inside your local repository, create an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file.

### Part 2: DOM Manipulation

- **HTML Setup**:

  - In `index.html`, create a `div` element with a unique ID to serve as a container for dynamic output.
  - Add a text input field and a button to facilitate user interaction.

- **JavaScript Interaction**:
  - In `script.js`, write code to create new `p` elements and append them to the container with dynamic content based on user input and logic.

### Part 3: Implementing Comparisons and Control Structures

- **User Input Logic**:
  - Implement a function that triggers when the button is clicked.
  - Use comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to evaluate the user input.
- **Control Structure Implementation**:
  - Use `if-else` statements to create different outputs based on the user input.
  - Display the results as text inside new `p` elements appended to the DOM.

### Part 4: Enhancing Output

- **Dynamic Output**:

  - Ensure the output in the DOM updates every time the user inputs a new value and clicks the button.

- **Commit and Push Changes**:
  - Commit your changes to your local repository with a meaningful message.
  - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository `JavaScriptLogicDOM` contains your `index.html` and `script.js`.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.

# Rubric for Week 6: Day 1 Assignment - Basic DOM Manipulation and JavaScript Logic (Total: /20 Points)

## 1. DOM Manipulation and Basic Setup - /10 Points

- **Fully Achieved - 10 pts**

  - Successfully created a new repository named JavaScriptLogicDOM and cloned it to the local machine.
  - Correctly set up the project structure with index.html and script.js.
  - index.html contains a div with a unique ID and user interaction elements (text input field and button).
  - script.js includes code for creating and appending new p elements to the div based on user input and logic.

- **Partially Achieved - 5 pts**

  - Repository and project structure are partially set up (missing elements or incorrect setup).
  - index.html contains basic required elements, but with minor issues.
  - script.js attempts to manipulate DOM but with limited success or errors.

- **Not Achieved - 0 pts**
  - Did not successfully create the repository or project structure.
  - index.html does not contain the required elements.
  - No evidence of attempt to manipulate DOM in script.js.

## 2. Implementing Logic and Dynamic Output - /10 Points

- **Fully Achieved - 10 pts**

  - Implemented a function that triggers upon button click and correctly uses comparison operators to evaluate user input.
  - Correctly used if-else statements for different outputs based on user input.
  - Dynamic output in the DOM is correctly updated with each new user input and button click.
  - Committed changes to local repository with a meaningful message and successfully pushed to GitHub.

- **Partially Achieved - 5 pts**

  - Function triggers on button click but has minor issues in using comparison operators.
  - Attempted to use if-else statements, but with limited success.
  - Dynamic output is partially functional or inconsistent.
  - Committed and pushed changes, but with less clarity in commit messages or minor issues in pushing to GitHub.

- **Not Achieved - 0 pts**
  - Did not implement a function that correctly triggers upon button click.
  - Failed to use comparison operators and if-else statements effectively.
  - No dynamic output or major issues in updating the DOM.
  - Did not commit changes with a meaningful message or failed to push to GitHub.
