# Week 6: Day 3 â€“ Callbacks and Understanding Value vs. Reference

## Format: Morning (2 hours)

**Purpose:** Familiarize students with the crucial concepts of callbacks and the difference between value and reference in JavaScript, setting the stage for more advanced topics.

---

## Hour 1: Delving into Callbacks

### What are Callbacks? (15 minutes):

- Introduce callbacks as functions passed into another function as an argument.
- Highlight the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and how callbacks play a pivotal role.

### Practical Uses of Callbacks (20 minutes):

- Demonstrate scenarios where callbacks are essential, such as event listeners, array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `forEach`, and asynchronous operations.

### Hands-On Callback Exercises (25 minutes):

- Provide students with tasks that require the implementation of callbacks.
- Challenges might involve creating custom functions that accept and utilize callbacks or exploring built-in methods that use callbacks.

## Hour 2: Value vs. Reference

### Understanding Primitive and Reference Types (20 minutes):

- Differentiate between primitive data types (e.g., numbers, strings) and reference data types (e.g., objects, arrays).
- Emphasize that primitives are copied by value, while reference types are copied by reference.

### Practical Demonstrations (25 minutes):

- Use real-world examples to showcase the difference between value and reference.
- Engage students in exercises that require them to distinguish between the two and predict code outcomes based on their understanding.

### Wrap-Up and Reflection (15 minutes):

- Recap the central themes of the day: callbacks and the distinction between value and reference.
- Offer a brief overview of Day 4's content, hinting at diving deeper into the Browser DOM and its manipulation using JavaScript.
