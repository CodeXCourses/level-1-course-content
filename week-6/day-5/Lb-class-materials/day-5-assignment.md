# Week 6: Day 5 Assignment - Consolidating JavaScript Concepts

## Objective

Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the week's key JavaScript concepts through a detailed and interactive web project.

## Instructions

Create a web page that consolidates the JavaScript skills learned during the week, with specific tasks focusing on DOM manipulation, loops, callback functions, array methods, and data types.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:

  - Create a repository named `JavaScriptWeekReview`.
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Inside the repository, create `index.html` and `script.js` files.

### Part 2: Comprehensive JavaScript Application

- **DOM Manipulation Task**:

  - In `index.html`, create a form with two input fields (e.g., `name` and `age`) and a submit button.
  - In `script.js`, write code to append the submitted form data as a list item in an unordered list on the page when the form is submitted.

- **Loop Implementation Task**:

  - Create an array of 5 colors (e.g., `["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]`).
  - Use a `for` loop to display each color as a separate paragraph on the page.
  - Implement a `while` loop that adds paragraphs to the page while a counter is less than 5, each paragraph displaying the counter's current value.

- **Callback Functions with Array Methods**:

  - Create an array of numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
  - Use the `map` method to double each number, the `filter` method to keep only even numbers, and the `forEach` method to display each number from the `filter` operation as a list item.

- **Data Types Exploration**:
  - Demonstrate the difference between copying primitive and reference types.
  - Show this by creating and manipulating variables of each type, and displaying the results on the page (e.g., copy and change an array vs a number).

### Part 3: Submission and Repository Maintenance

- **Commit and Push Changes**:
  - Regularly commit your changes with clear messages.
  - Push the final version to the GitHub repository.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository `JavaScriptWeekReview` contains the completed project.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.

## Rubric

### Application of JavaScript Concepts - /20

#### DOM Manipulation and Loop Implementation - /10

- **Fully Achieved - 10 pts**

  - Excellently implements form submission and displays the data using DOM manipulation.
  - Effectively uses `for` and `while` loops to display array items and counter values.

- **Partially Achieved - 5 pts**

  - Basic implementation of form submission and data display with some inaccuracies.
  - Demonstrates an understanding of loops but may have minor errors or incomplete execution.

- **Not Achieved - 0 pts**
  - Inadequate or incorrect implementation of form submission and data display.
  - Fails to correctly use `for` and `while` loops to accomplish the given tasks.

#### Array Methods and Data Type Exploration - /10

- **Fully Achieved - 10 pts**

  - Correctly applies `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` methods with callback functions to manipulate and display array data.
  - Clearly demonstrates the difference between copying primitive and reference types with appropriate examples.

- **Partially Achieved - 5 pts**

  - Basic use of array methods with some inaccuracies or incomplete understanding of callback functions.
  - Some demonstration of data type differences but lacks clarity or depth.

- **Not Achieved - 0 pts**
  - Incorrect or incomplete use of array methods.
  - Fails to demonstrate or incorrectly explains the differences between primitive and reference types.
