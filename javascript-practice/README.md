# JavaScript Practice Resources

Mastering JavaScript will be the hardest part of becoming a developer. It will also take the longest time. If possible, we can introduce a little JavaScript each week.

## Resources

* Programming with MIT Scratch: This can help visualize code and code blocks.
* Programming with [Microsoft Make Code](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/teach): this is like scratch, but it can also be converted into Python or JavaScript.
* Head First Programming (Book): Very useful ideas for introducing programming concepts (In Python.)

### Books for students

* [Head First JavaScript](https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Head_First_JavaScript_Programming.html?id=GhssAwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) This book is not quite as clear as Head First Programming, but still good.
* [HTML&CSS](https://www.google.com.tw/books/edition/HTML_and_CSS/aGjaBTbT0o0C) Beautifully illustrated guide to basic HTML. Maybe be available in the local library.

## Weekly Guide

### Week 1

Introduce executing JS in the Dev Tools Console. Here are some ideas, it's not necessary to try all of them, but you can see which will interest students.

* Using JS as a calculator.
* Give a sample program to copy/paste into the console and work through. 
* Add the sample program to [snippets](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets#open).
* Click on the "eye" to watch a variable in the Console.
* introduce `document.querySelector` and right click on the element in the Elements tab and select Copy -> Copy JS Path. You can add `.style.border="..."` to set style on the elements.
* Have students install an extension like ViolentMonkey. Copy in code there to execute each time a page is visited.
* There may be other extensions that can be installed.

Introduce executing JS in node on the terminal. (This would require installing node.) Here are some ideas...

* Using JS as a calculator in the terminal.
* Copy/paste a simple program. (Note: there isn't an easy way to accept a prompt from the user without and npm package.)
* Copy/paste a simple program into a file. Run it with node.
