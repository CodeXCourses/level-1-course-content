# Week 7: Day 5 – Capstone Ideas, Wireframing, and Building a JavaScript Project

## Session Outline

Focus: Presenting capstone project ideas, covering the basics of wireframing and project planning, followed by a live coding session to build a simple JavaScript-based application, such as a tip calculator.

## Objectives

1. Introduce potential ideas for capstone projects.
2. Discuss the importance of wireframing and planning in project development.
3. Demonstrate building a basic but practical JavaScript application.

## Announcements

- **Capstone Project Preparation**: Start conceptualizing your capstone project, considering today's discussion and demonstration.
- **Hands-On Approach**: Today’s session includes a practical coding demonstration to implement a simple JavaScript solution.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Capstone Project Ideas

- Sharing a variety of potential capstone project ideas.
- Encouraging creativity and the application of accumulated skills in project concepts.

### 2. Wireframing and Planning

- Introduction to wireframing: creating a visual guide for web project layouts.
- Discussing the planning phase: setting objectives, defining features, and organizing content.

### 3. Building a JavaScript Application

- **Tip Calculator Project**:
  - Live coding a simple tip calculator to demonstrate form handling and basic DOM manipulation.
  - Explaining each step of the development process, from HTML structure to JavaScript functionality.

### 4. Implementing Core JavaScript Concepts

- Applying fundamental JavaScript concepts in a practical application.
- Demonstrating the use of variables, functions, event listeners, and basic calculations.

## Interactive Elements

- **Project Idea Brainstorming**: Interactive session for students to discuss and brainstorm their own capstone project ideas.
- **Wireframing Activity**: Guided exercise on creating a basic wireframe for a web project.
- **Code-Along Tutorial**: Participants follow along with the tip calculator build, applying core JavaScript skills.

## Wrap-Up

- Review of the day’s activities with an emphasis on how to start planning and developing capstone projects.
- Encouraging students to use the tip calculator project as a reference for their own projects.
- Open Q&A session for further discussion on project ideas and JavaScript implementation.
