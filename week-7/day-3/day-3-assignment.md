# Assignment: Create a Product Display Page using Bootstrap

## Instructions

### 1. Setup Environment
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Create a new folder named `Bootstrap_Day3_Assignment`.

### 2. Create Files
   - Inside the `Bootstrap_Day3_Assignment` folder, create a new file named `index.html`.
   - Create another new file named `styles.css`.

### 3. Implement Bootstrap and Styling
   - Link Bootstrap's CSS in your `index.html` using the official BootstrapCDN.
   - Ensure your `styles.css` file is properly linked in your `index.html` file.

### 4. Structure Your Page
