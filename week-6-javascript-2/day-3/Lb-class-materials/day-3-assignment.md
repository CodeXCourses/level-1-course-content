# Week 6: Day 3 Assignment - Callback Functions and Array Methods

## Objective

Demonstrate understanding and application of callback functions and array methods (`map`, `filter`, `forEach`) in JavaScript.

## Instructions

This assignment involves practical tasks that require the use of callback functions with array methods.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
  - Create a new repository named `CallbackArrayMethods`.
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Inside your local repository, create an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file.

### Part 2: Implementing Array Methods with Callbacks

- **Using `map` Method**:
  - Create an array of numbers in `script.js`.
  - Use the `map` method with a callback function to modify each element (e.g., multiply by 2) and log the new array.

- **Applying `filter` Method**:
  - Use the `filter` method with a callback to filter elements of the array (e.g., keep only even numbers).

- **Exploring `forEach` Method**:
  - Utilize the `forEach` method to iterate over the array and perform an action for each element (e.g., log each element to the console).

- **Commit and Push Changes**:
  - Commit your changes to your local repository with a meaningful message.
  - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository `CallbackArrayMethods` contains your `index.html` and `script.js` with the implemented exercises.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository in the "Your work" card.
