# Week 6: Day 3 â€“ Callback Functions and Array Methods in JavaScript

## Session Outline

Focus: Introducing callback functions and array methods in JavaScript, while also distinguishing between reference and primitive types.

## Objectives

1. Understand the concept and use of callback functions in JavaScript.
2. Explore JavaScript array methods: `map`, `filter`, and `forEach`.
3. Differentiate between reference types and primitive types.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Introduction to Callback Functions

- Definition and role of callback functions in JavaScript.
- Simple examples of callback functions for easy understanding.

### 2. Exploring Array Methods

- Deep dive into `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` methods.
- Practical use cases of these methods with callback functions.

### 3. Array Methods in Action

- Demonstrating how to use `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` in real-world scenarios.
- Hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts.

### 4. Understanding Reference vs Primitive Types

- Differentiating between reference types (Objects, Arrays) and primitive types (String, Number, Boolean, etc.).
- Explaining how JavaScript handles these types differently.

### 5. Practical Implications of Type Differences

- Discussing the impact of type differences in JavaScript code.
- Common pitfalls and best practices when working with different types.

## Interactive Elements

- **Code-Along Exercises**: Participants actively engage in coding examples and exercises.
- **Practical Demonstrations**: Showcasing the use of callback functions and array methods in various scenarios.
- **Type Comparison Challenges**: Exercises that highlight the differences between reference and primitive types.

## Wrap-Up

- Summarizing the key aspects of callback functions, array methods, and type differences.
- Setting the stage for more advanced JavaScript topics in upcoming sessions.
- Open Q&A for students to clarify concepts and ask questions.
