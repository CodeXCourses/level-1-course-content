# Week 6: Day 1 â€“ Introduction to DOM Manipulation and Control Structures

## Session Outline

Focus: Beginning with basic DOM manipulation in JavaScript, followed by an introduction to comparisons and control structures.

## Objectives

1. Gain familiarity with the Document Object Model (DOM) and learn basic DOM manipulation techniques.
2. Understand the role of comparisons and control structures in programming.
3. Apply learned concepts through hands-on coding exercises.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Introduction to DOM Manipulation

- Understanding the DOM: What it is and its importance in web development.
- Basic DOM manipulation: Creating and appending elements.

### 2. First Steps in DOM Manipulation

- Creating an HTML container for dynamic content.
- Using JavaScript to select elements and create new content.
- Appending new elements to the DOM.

### 3. Understanding Comparisons

- The role of comparisons in programming logic.
- Differentiating between comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

### 4. Truthy and Falsy Values

- Introduction to truthy and falsy concepts in JavaScript.
- Practical implications of these values in conditional statements.

### 5. Introduction to Control Structures

- Exploring conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- Real-world application of these structures in web programming.

## Interactive Elements

- **Practical Demonstrations**: Live coding examples illustrating DOM manipulation.
- **Code-Along Segments**: Participants will engage in coding exercises to apply the concepts of comparisons and control structures.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Use cases where students apply logical constructs to solve problems.

## Wrap-Up

- Recap of the day's content, focusing on DOM manipulation and its integration with logical structures.
- Preview of the next session's topics.
- Open Q&A session for clarifications and further discussions.
