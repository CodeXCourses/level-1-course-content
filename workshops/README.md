# Workshops

Workshops are an important part of the class to give students time to practice. They can be used a variety of ways.

## Pair programming

You can divide students into groups of 2, 3 or 4 and questions that one person shares screen and the other navigate. It helps to have a TA present in the room or at least checking in.

## Mini code reviews

If there is a big project that students are working on, sometimes a 5-10 minute code review is helpful. Having each student undergo a mandatory mini code review each day can help them open up and help you discover blockers that they wouldn't otherwise tell you about.
