# Topic Map

This is a document that attempts to map out what is needed to learn a concept, and which prior topics or concepts would help in introducing a later concept.

The goal is to introduce as many simple concepts as possible in the early weeks of the course so that when you get to the later weeks, in JavaScript, students will have some background knowledge to fall back on.

## Topics

### Priors

#### Week 1 Dev Tools

In the dev tools...

...Introducing variables and objects

    let myButton = document.body.getElementById("myButton");
    myButton.textContent = "Hello World"
    myButton.style.color = "red";

...Introducing arrays and indexes

    let pTags = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
    pTag[1].style.color = "red";
    pTag[2].style.color = "purple";
