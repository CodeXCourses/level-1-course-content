# TA Handbook

## TA Duties

TA's will be assigned 7 hours of duties each week. These duties include:

* Grading
* Mentorship
* Assisting Teachers During Class

## Grading

Although different classes will have different assignments and different types of assignments, there are some commonalities.

Please monitor the assignment deadlines in Moodle.

Ideally, each student's assignments should be graded 24 hours after it is handed in. But at least, try to grade the assignments 24 hours after it it due.

## Resubmitted assignments

Resubmitting assignments is an important part of our student's educational progress. It helps us know if the students are trying and also lets us know what they are having problems with before it is too late to help.

It is especially important to give student prompt feedback on assignments they resubmit. This will help us get them the help they need before they fall further behind.

The comments section of an assignment can be a good place for Q and A between student and TA. If students appear to need more help, respond with your Calendly link (or that of the teacher) and encourage them the make an appointment to clear things up.

The teacher will monitor the comments, but if you feel a student has an important question, or is having particular trouble with a topic, you can bring it to the teacher's attention via Slack or email.

## Feedback on Coding Assignments

Coding assignments are not always straightforward to grade. They may be detailed and intricate.

There are many ways to approach grading them, but be mindful of how much time you spend on each one. Use tools like your Rubric to save time instead of writing up detailed feedback.

It is often more effective to leave a short comment as feedback and expect a response from the student. That way you can have a dialog instead of a monologue and it's more likely that the student will understand and react to your feedback.

If there is a lot you'd like to tell the student, or if there is a large gap in knowledge, keep the immediate feedback short, and ask the student to make a calendly appointment. Or focus on one thing at a time and request multiple re-submissions of the assignment.

Here is a good formula for how your feedback should go for work that needs a resubmission:

1. Say one positive thing about the submission.

2. Say one thing that the student could work better on.

3. Give one or more actionable instructions that the student can pick up and work on.
