# TA Handbook

## TA Duties

TA's will be assigned 7 hours of duties each week. These duties include:

* Grading
* Mentorship
* Assisting Teachers During Class

## Grading

Although different classes will have different assignments and different types of assignments, there are some commonalities.

Please monitor the assignment deadlines in Moodle.

Ideally, each student's assignments should be graded 24 hours after it is handed in. But at least, try to grade the assignments 24 hours after it it due.

## Resubmitted assignments

Resubmitting assignments is an important part of our student's educational progress. It helps us know if the students are trying and also lets us know what they are having problems with before it is too late to help.

It is especially important to give student prompt feedback on assignments they resubmit. This will help us get them the help they need before they fall further behind.

The comments section of an assignment can be a good place for Q and A between student and TA. If students appear to need more help, respond with your Calendly link (or that of the teacher) and encourage them the make an appointment to clear things up.

The teacher will monitor the comments, but if you feel a student has an important question, or is having particular trouble with a topic, you can bring it to the teacher's attention via Slack or email.

## Feedback on Coding Assignments

Coding assignments are not always straightforward to grade. They may be detailed and intricate.

There are many ways to approach grading them, but be mindful of how much time you spend on each one. Use tools like your Rubric to save time instead of writing up detailed feedback.

It is often more effective to leave a short comment as feedback and expect a response from the student. That way you can have a dialog instead of a monologue and it's more likely that the student will understand and react to your feedback.

If there is a lot you'd like to tell the student, or if there is a large gap in knowledge, keep the immediate feedback short, and ask the student to make a calendly appointment. Or focus on one thing at a time and request multiple re-submissions of the assignment.

Here is a good formula for how your feedback should go for work that needs a resubmission:

1. Say one positive thing about the submission.

2. Say one thing that the student could work better on.

3. Give one or more actionable instructions that the student can pick up and work on.

## Communication with Teacher

Most questions you have should be directed at the teacher of the course. Try to keep in touch via slack and video conference. Let the teacher know if you've graded an assignment or if you will be late with grading an assignment.

It's a good idea to let the teacher know of any students you feel are struggling. A simple Slack message can be enough to let the teacher know who is have problems and what topic is giving them problems.

## Setting and logging hours

You are responsible for setting your own hours for work within limits. There may be times when the teacher would like you to be present in class to help with group work, but you will usually be able to choose which hours you work. Be sure to log your hours as soon as you can: the same day or the same week as when you work them.

### Mentoring Duties

Set up an calendly.com account so you can accept students to mentor. If you get more than 3 or 4 hours in a week, let the teacher and Lilian know so you don't go over the allotted hours without warning. (We do encourage mentoring, but we want to make sure it is having an impact.)

### Grading Duties

Grades will usually be set up with a due date. Try to schedule your time so that you can respond to the submission within 24 hours. You may find yourself checking in with submissions or re-submissions as they come in. Try to keep track of those hours, as well. If you can't, you may just wait until the next time you schedule work hours.

### In class assistance

In a larger class, a teacher might need assistance managing group work. In this case, work out with the teacher what times you are needed. Ideally, these could be the same each week, so you can schedule your time effectively.
