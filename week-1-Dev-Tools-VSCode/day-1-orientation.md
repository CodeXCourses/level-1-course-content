# Orientation

Orientation will serve to kick of the class, motivate the students, set expectations, take a role call of who actually shows up, and inspire students by setting a tone of success and improvement.

## Role call

Some of our classes have initial rosters that are not set in stone. We will work to make sure that all students who want to are prepared to at attend the orientation. Then we can see who actually shows up to the course. Make a spreadsheet of the student who plan to attend by distributing a Google Form. Also have a backup method, like auto transcribing meeting in Google Meet, to keep a record of participants, taking screenshots of the participant list in the Meet, and double checking the emails that students enter into the form.

## Is this class for you?

This section might be useful to set expectations for the students.

* You want to learn an exciting and in-demand skill.
* You like learning new things.
* You don't have any experience with coding, but want to learn.
* You have some coding experience, but want to learn about web development.
* You can dedicate 3 hours each day to learning a new skill.

## Teach the first day

Starting with a gee-wiz demo that students can try, will help students realize that they can learn something interesting the first day.

For example, opening dev tools and changing the headline of the local paper, has a wow factor and leads into what we will do for the Dev Tools topic in the first week. Changing colors can be fun, too. You could even introduce JavaScript by copy/pasting code into the console.
