# Homework for Week 3: Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Bootstrap and Basic Styling

Goal of this assignment is get you used to using Bootstrap and to get you thinking about how to use Bootstrap to style your projects.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `Bootstrap_Day1_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

    - Create a new file named `index.html`.
    - We will just be using the `index.html` file for this assignment since we will be bringing in Bootstrap from a CDN.

3. **index.html Structure**

    - Experiment with the Bootstrap classes we learned about in class today.
    - Try the different button classes and their variations, try updating the text within the buttons.
    - Wrap these buttons in different containers and see how the containers affect the buttons.
    - Feel free to experiment with other Bootstrap classes as well. (We are going into grids, rows, columns and other concepts tomorrow...)
    - You can mix in HTML elements with Bootstrap classes as well. For example, you can have a `<h1>` element with a Bootstrap class around it.
    - Experiment, have some fun, this assignment is less technical and more about getting you used to using Bootstrap.
