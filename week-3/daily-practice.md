# Day 1

Setup: fork the repo, clone, and open it in VSCode. Run live server, and setup your screen so VSCode is on the left two thirds of your screen, and your browser is on the right one third of the screen.

(If you don't have VSCode setup, you may use Replit.)

## Task

First, update your README.md file. Then start the task below.

In index.html:

1. Add two article tags.
2. In each article tag, add a h1, h2, and p tags.
3. Add at least 2 em and strong tags in each p tag.
4. Add two lists (ul) with at least three items (li) each.

In style.css

5. Set the font-family and background-color on body
6. Set the color on the h1 elements
7. Set the color on the strong elements
8. Set the border on the p tags
9. On your own, choose at least one more property to set on another tag.
10. Set the list-style-type on the ul elements.

**bonus** Do one or more of the following tasks to extend your knowledge and skill. You may need to do some research on your own to find the answer.

* Try setting padding, margin, border, and background-color to the various elements.
* Use an ID selector to set the list-style-type on the two lists separately.

## Turn in

You will not need to turn this in until the third day's work is complete.

# Day 2

**Setup:** Use the repo from Day 1. Add a file called cool-cats.html. Add a file called cool-cats.css. *Be sure to set up your screen so you can see the result as you type your code.*

Copy the HTML code from the gist into cool-cats.html

You won't need to modify that HTML.

Gist: https://gist.github.com/rmccrear/6306d9a239aa9b96fcc43cba5f0b2d21

In cool-cats.html

1. In head, create a link tag to link the cool-cats.css style sheet.
2. find three pictures of cats on pexels.com, rename them frisky.jpg, trixy.jpg, and fluffy.jpg

In cool-cats.css we will apply styles to different elements in the HTML file.

1. style all the ul and ol tags with color and list-style-type
2. style all the h1 and h3 tags with a color
3. style the h3 tags that are descendants of article with a different color
4. style all p tags with a little padding (10px or so)
5. style all p tags that are descendants of an article with more padding 
6. add a rule to style all p tags that are descendants of an article with a grey color
7. style all p tags that are descendents of footer to have a small font-size (you may choose how you wish to set the size, just shrink it down)
8. style all ul tags that are descendants of an article tag with a different color and list-style-type

**Bonus Challenge:** style all ul tags that are descendants of an nav tag to become navbars.


# Day 3


**Setup:** Use the repo from Day 1. Add a file called layout.html. Add a file called layout.css. *Be sure to set up your screen so you can see the result as you type your code.*

Copy the HTML code from the gist into layout.html

Gist:

https://gist.github.com/rmccrear/3b52f307ee148d1b84d908abf1df0436

**In layout.css...**

1. add a different background-color to header, main, and aside so you can see them.
2. set the widths on main and aside. Make them add up to 100%. (or 97%)
3. float the main to the left and the aside to the right
4. **In layout.html** add a ul with three li to the aside.
5. **In layout.html** add at least two h3 tags and two p tags to the main.
6. **In layout.html** add a picture right in front of each picture
7. **In layout.css...** float the pictures.
8. **In layout.css...** add border, margin, padding to the pictures
9. Add any other style or html you like to make the design work.

**Bonus:** Try this if you finish the previous work.

* style the ul in the aside to look like a menu.
* add a footer tag at the bottom. research css clear float for the CSS rule to make the footer play well with the floated elements above it. (This can be tricky! But it amounts to only one line of code!)
* for more practice, create a file called gallery.html and gallery.css. Make some div tags and float them in various ways.
