# Homework for Week 3: Day 5 â€“ Project Finalization, Best Practices, and Beyond

This assignment will be the creation of a new site idea like we have previously done with the products page. This time you will be creating a site that is unique to you and your interests. This site can be anything you want it to be. Utilize [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for images if you need them. Some ideas you could create are: a writer's blog, a personal site, a recipe sharing site, a travel blog, or anything else you want.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**

   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Create a new folder named `Bootstrap_Day5_Assignment` on your local machine.

2. **Create Files**

    - Create a new file named `index.html` and `styles.css`.
    - You can create additional page files if your design requires it.

3. **index.html Structure**

    - Ensure you are properly bringing in Bootstrap via instructions from the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).
    - There is no set structure for this assignment, you are free to create whatever you want. Ensure you have a design idea in place and that it is recognizable as a site.
    - Try to use as much of the Bootstrap components and utilities as you can. We introduced some components like the modal that have JavaScript, you are NOT obligated to add these at this point, but you can try! It will be beneficial practice as we move into next week.
    - Feel free to mix in HTML elements that you have learned as well.

4. **styles.css**

    - Ensure you have your `styles.css` file linked to your `index.html` file and any additional files you create.
    - Add some styling to your `index.html` file using CSS.
    - You were introduced to extensions such as Bootswatch and Bootstrap-select. Try to utilize some type of extension to customize your site!
    - Make the page unique to your own style or look up other designs for inspiration.

5. **Submission**

    - Zip the "Bootstrap_Day5_Assignment" folder.
    - In the card with the label "Your work" click on the "+ Add or create."
    - Within that dropdown click file, and attach your zipped folder.
    - Click the submit button.
    **or**
    - If you are using Replit for your assignments, submit the link to your Replit assignment in the card with the label "Bootstrap_Day5_Assignment".
