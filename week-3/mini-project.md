# CSS Mini Project

Make three pages:

* index.html
* about.html
* gallery.html

In index.html have a layout with header, main, aside, and footer. 

* Use float to put main on the left and aside on the right.
* Use ul and li in aside
* Use h1, p, img in main
* Put the copyright in footer
* link to the other two pages

In about.html create a simple with h1, h2, p and a list. This should be little bio about you, the author of the page. (If you like, you can make this into a fictional character.)

In gallery.html add several pictures from pexels. Put the pictures in div elements and use float and width properties to do the layout to look like a photo gallery.

Finally, use at least three CSS functions. Check this documentation for some ideas: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_functions.php

Bonus:

* create custom buttons
* add a table
* have a sublist in one of your lists.
