# Example Problems

## Exercises for Boolean conditions

For each of the problems, follow our problems solving strategies to solve the problems.  Then use one or more the Problem Solving Boilerplate to express the answer. Finally, create a simple website with HTML tags h1, h2, and p tags explaining your problem and answer. If you can, try using a script tag and JavaScript to solve the problem or a similar related problem.

Problem solving strategies: Draw a picture, make up numbers, try a specific example, solve a similar problem.

Problem solving boilerplate:

State problem, State your givens (let X be ...), Write Pseudocode (IF...THEN...), give a concrete example.

1. A given turkey at market has a set price and a set weight. Mother tells us to buy a turkey if it costs less than $9 and weighs more than 12 pounds. Write a condition using mathematical terms that will tell you if you should buy the turkey. Hint: let p be price and w be weight of the sample turkey.

2. You work in an ice cream shop. You have vanilla, chocolate, and cherry ice cream in stock. You are out of blueberry and rocky road. You are out of waffle cones, but have plenty of regular cones and cups. Write a condition to indicate if you can fulfill a particular customer's order or not. Hint: let f be ice cream flavor, let c be kind of cone.

3. Every ice cream cone you sell costs the customer $1.15. It costs you $1.00 to produce it. At the end of the month, you promised your children they can visit Disney World if you make $1000 in profit this month. Given X number of cones sold, write a condition that will indicate if you can take the trip. Hint: let t be the total ice cream cones you produce in the month.

4. Have saved up $1000 for your Disneyland trip. You set additional conditions for your 3 children, Able, Ben, and Cathy. Two of the three must get an A on their spelling test at the end of the month. All three must pass their math tests. None of them can be late for school. Express the conditions under which the trip CANNOT occur. Hint: let a1, b1, and c1 be the scores of the children on their spelling test. Let a2, b2, and c2 be how many times they are late for school in the month.
