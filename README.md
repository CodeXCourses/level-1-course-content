### Weeks 4–8: Computer Science Discovery, Unit 3 — Interactive Animations & Game Lab Programming

#### Unit 3 Overview

This unit introduces learners to the foundational concepts of computer programming through the creation of images, animations, interactive art, and simple games using Code.org’s Game Lab. While developing technical skills—such as drawing shapes, using variables, creating animations, and building interactive games—participants will also practice **essential soft skills**. The curriculum emphasizes teamwork, communication, brainstorming, problem-solving, giving and receiving feedback, and iterating on creative ideas. Throughout the unit, group activities, mini-projects, and collaborative planning build confidence working independently and as part of a team.

* Google Folder with extra material [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/183MYBR1JYLeGGrMS9NPF9avjGGJmjAP9?usp=sharing)

**Goals:**

* Build a strong foundation in JavaScript-based programming using Game Lab
* Develop problem-solving skills through the programming process (Define, Prepare, Try, Reflect)
* **Strengthen soft skills** including communication, creative brainstorming, teamwork, and peer feedback
* Practice planning, prototyping, and presenting projects in small groups
* Complete and present individual and collaborative projects in Game Lab

**By the end of this unit, learners will be able to:**

* Draw and manipulate shapes using code in Game Lab
* Use variables, randomness, and parameters to customize programs
* Create and control sprites, text, animation, and user interaction
* Apply conditionals, loops, and functions to build more complex behavior
* Use abstraction, project planning, and iterative improvement when building interactive projects
* **Collaborate effectively**—work in teams, communicate technical ideas, brainstorm solutions, and provide constructive feedback
* **Present creative work and technical concepts** to peers, demonstrating both technical skill and clear communication
