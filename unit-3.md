# **Unit 3: Game Lab Programming Syllabus**

---

## **Week 4: Introduction to Game Lab & Basic Drawing**

**Focus:**
Launch the unit with the problem-solving process and begin hands-on programming using Game Lab.

---

### **Daily Breakdown**

#### **Monday: Unit 2 Wrap-up**

##### **Goals**

The main goals for today are to review core HTML and CSS concepts, help everyone consolidate their learning by creating a personal cheatsheet, and reinforce understanding of how files work both online and locally. There will also be time to finish one-on-one interviews or code reviews to check in on individual progress.

---

##### **Topics Covered**

Today’s topics include a fundamental review of HTML and CSS, an introduction to how clients and servers interact with web files, and hands-on practice downloading, editing, and running files locally. The class will also focus on synthesizing learning by building a custom cheatsheet and sharing it with the group.
