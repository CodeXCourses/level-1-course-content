# Scoring

## Badge Scoring

Each BADGE is a steppingstone along the PATHWAY. There are about 10 badges for each pathway. You must keep up with the badges as you move through the course. (Each badge will take about a week of class time to complete, including homework and classwork.)

Each Badge is PASS/SOFT-FAIL/HARD-FAIL.

You must complete all the badges before attempting the Capstone project.

To PASS the badge, you must have at least an 85% in the Badge’s grading category. You will see all the assignments for the badge category in Google Classroom. And all the assignments for the Badge will be assigned during the course of the week.

If you have at least 60% in a Badge’s grading category that is a SOFT-FAIL. You can go back and re-do the assignments you have done for re-grades or complete ones if you haven’t finished. 

If you have less than 60% that is a HARD-FAIL, and you must schedule time with a TA or mentor on the following week to try and catch up. The mentor will work with you to find out what changes you need to make to improve. The mentor may help you to develop a study schedule that will meet your goals. Or you might need help finding the material you need. 

Of course, you can always choose to schedule time with a mentor even if you are passing all your badges. We encourage you to take advantage the opportunity to work with our spectacular TA’s and mentors!

Note: Each assignment you do will be associated with a Badge. The individual assignments do not count toward your final grade. They count only toward the Badge. Each Badge will be scored as 100% or 0% in your final grade. At the end of the PATHWAY, you must have a grade of 100% before you submit your Capstone project.


## Capstone Scoring

The Capstone project also has a PASS/SOFT-FAIL/HARD-FAIL grade. They are in the form on interviews conducted by professional software developers. You will share your project to the interviewer. As you share your project, the interviewer will ask you questions about the development process, the code you wrote, and how you overcame difficulties along the way. Their goal is to help you express yourself and understand the process you went through. If you have done a good job on the project, they will be able to help you express that over the course of the interview. If you’ve had difficulties, they will be able to help you pinpoint them and help you adjust course. There’s no need to be nervous, but you do need to be prepared.

A SOFT-FAIL on the Capstone will mean you need to make adjustments to your project and try again. 

A HARD-FAIL means you will have to go back and study. You will need to meet with a mentor to figure out ways you can course correct before trying again. You may have to re-do work on Badges, complete new assignments given by your mentor, or read/watch material from the Suggested Learning section.


### Note to teacher

To make 9 Badges that count as pass/fail and a number of assignments for each badge that only count toward that badge will be a challenge using Google Classroom. We can “hack” Google Classroom’s sparce grading features to come up with something that will not be confusing.

First, the Badge Assignments will be created as something that the students don’t need to turn in. It will be manually calculated based on the scores of a Grading Category. Then the Badge Assignment will be scored as 0 or 100 based on the scores of assignments in a given unit.

So, we will create 10 Grading Categories: VSCode, Dev Tools, HTML, CSS… and so one. Plus, one Grading Category called Badges. The Badges Grading Category will be 100% and the others will be worth 0%. As we go, students who get a PASS on each, will get a 100% score. Those who don’t will see 0% if they have zero PASSes, or 50% if they have one PASS and one FAIL.  (Alternatively, we can reset the scores each week, so on CSS week, the CSS Grading Category will be worth 100%. When the Badge is done, we shift to the next. But that would get confusing to students who fall behind.)

Another issue is Google Classroom doesn’t let you re-arrange the way assignments are laid out in the gradebook. They are presented in the order they are created by the teacher. So, you will have to take care to create all of the assignments for one Badge all together to make it easier for the student to see the grouping. (Or you could create all the Badge assignments first, and have them all at one end. Or you could even delete and re-create all the Badge assignments when a badge is done and re-enter grades manually for each student—0 or 100, and have them all at the other end. Yes, it’s a hack.)
